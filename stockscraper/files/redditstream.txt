I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
[removed]
Same thing I do every day....

1. Look at all the stock gains I missed out on.
2. Get massive FOMO
3. Buy deep into something I think hasn’t mooned yet.
4. Watch it drop like a rock. 
5. Paper hand like a bitch
6. Cry profusely
7. Do it again
Absolutely dog shit mental health day
PLTR could cure cancer and that fucker would be down 5% on that day
DID EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD FUCKING DAY TRADING TODAY? ALL TIME HIGHS AGAIN BABY!!!!

i'm down 10k on the day
Just closed on a 1 bedroom condo in the flatiron district nyc. I feel like i made it man. Gonna hit up wayfair and deck up the living room :)))
SPY 420 4/20 was never a meme
how quickly i go from "i hope i can make a decent profit" to "fuck me i hope i can break even" lol
Today was garbage
Five stages of a Palantard:  denial, anger, bargaining, depression, and coma.
So PLTR demo day shows how it's software can drop stock prices? First in January now in April, I mean I'm pretty impressed.
shoutout to the guy who said hes ending his toxic relationship with DKNG today, I would be absolutely fuming right now
Breaking: Biden announces us dollar will be tied to PLTR to end inflation once and for all.
Some things never change. Death, taxes, and PLTR at $23
 Please explain to me how THE FUCK spy is up this much and I'm STILL red.
gonna go to home depot after a lot of research into proper thread count. i dont want the rope to break in half like my portfolio did today.
Ah yes my streak continues. Bigly red while market major green.
My moves are to do NOTHING. The hardest thing for me when im in a play is to let it play out
I'm from the future, whatever you were thinking of doing - do the opposite.
10 baggers are dope except when they’re in the other direction and you got the 1/10th bagger.
where is that PLTR 30K -> 500K challenge guy
Every stock in this thread was bleeding. All the meme stocks got hammered today. The market is at all time high, VIX is at all time low, premiums crashing big time. Our lunch money is being taken in front out of eyes, we are been attacked from all fronts.
I almost made money today
Spy will have its 420 on 4/20. The prophecy foretold
Oopsie poopsie I halved my portfolio
PLTR + MVIS we will have our day soon
Tomorrow I'm intentionally flagging my account as a PDT and locking myself out to prevent further damage.
Draftkings Named NFL Sports Betting Partner
Market right now feels like that expensive vacation you put completely on a credit card with a 23% interest rate.
Tomorrow I will watch my money burn like every other day
Who is this guy "Margin" and why does he keep calling me?
Fuck this market, nio fucked me hard today. Fuck pltr
I will not nut until I'm a millionaire. Will to power
PLTR bagholders continue to lose hope they weren't even aware they still had!
Why does PLTR have to be such a dumb bitch.
Imagine losing everything because someone drew a big triangle on a meme stock
Save this comment, RIOT either blows up... or my portfolio does.
You'd think QS fucked this guys wife or something.
dear PLTR, 

either trade in the teens so i can buy more

or trade in the thirties so i can buy more

at this rate, you’ll still be trading in the 20s in the year 2050

thank you

sincerely, yours retarded.
Tomorrow I guess I watch my PLTR position keep fucking me
Wait some of you actually *made* money today?
palantir broke my heart for the 128th time today
my 1 dollar fractional share of COIN has become 93 cents, should I pull out or double down
Me finding money on the ground five years ago: *"Holy Shit it's a great fucking day! 5 Dollars Bitches!!'*

Me losing thousands in a day now:
*"Wow that was kinda nuts, lol. Not too bad though tbh."*
APHA really fucked me good. I should sell, but I think I'll just keep buying more and watch it plummet some more.

It's my favorite activity
THIS IS THE LAST TIME I TAKE STOCK ADVICE FROM SOME HOE SHAKING HER ASS ON TIK TOK
Whenever I do the obvious thing, I lose money. Whenever I don't do the obvious thing, I also lose money.

I guess I should just do nothing.
Sold my SPY calls today so we should expect moon type levels in the upcoming weeks. 

You’re welcome.
Hey holy shit, we did great today!

*turns phone right side up*

Oh, f***!
DKNG up 5% after hours. DKNG down 3% tomorrow. Got it
AAPL please don’t fail me
People have realized that its more productive to buy a meme dog currency than it is to be participating in this shit market... Says a lot
Honestly, I don't even wanna touch my infested portfolio with my worst enemy's dick. I'm disgusting.
Imagine just going through life and not knowing about the stock market
My plan is to lose another 3% in PLTR
I give TSLA permission to hit $800 tomorrow
Market was very green today. No wonder I was very red today
PLTR making dividend stocks feel like the right move lol
if $SPY is green tomorrow I will ban myself from this subreddit and options forever. i have like $4k in puts rn.
Truly ironic seeing these Fast Money analysts calling "pouring fuel on the fire" of a stock irresponsible - yet they go on-air and do it every single damn day.
I haven't made money in so long
Dude I fucking suck at this.
It's really uncanny how the market can so accurately fuck me over with pinpoint surgical precision every time.
I just want to be right about the random TSLA spike one time
The more I trade the more I lose

Side long play is PSFE as they are DKNGs partner
Fuck you UWMC, you sideways trading trash. Puts on my $11 calls for april
I don’t have the energy to participate in this housing market anymore.  I’m tired of bidding high on overpriced average houses and losing to some crazy who YOLOs 100k over.  My little rental is looking better and better every day
fuckthis market im joining theta gang
PLTR had two of its ribs removed so it can suck its own dick
This subreddit has collectively lost at least.........200 dollars to PLTR
Tomorrow is friday.  So i'm getting drunk as fuck and eating chicken fingers.
Losing money, apparently it’s what I love most in life
Nio can’t hurt me anymore because my calls are at -79%.
You ever just get pissed at losing 80% of your portfolio on some dumbass trades so you just say fuck it and yolo 4/16 416 calls? Cause I did. Let the gods decide idgaf anymore lmao
That had to be the reddest green day I’ve ever had...
What bigger partnership could DraftKings have gotten then the nfl?
I neglect putting up $$ for my car but will fire off $$$ into my account for a naked call on a stock that I spent less than 10 mins looking into without even blinking. Maybe I have a problem
SPY is itching for a 5% day
My 401k is outperforming my memefolio. I may actually suck at this

What happened to all my money.
Spy ATH 

My account -8% 

Fucking magic
Told my husband I got fucked real hard by APHA & PLTR which means the steak and sex I planned for his birthday tonight is now Kraft dinner and a bj. Hoping for a miracle
Does the market actually gain money? I don't think I've made a profit yet.
I've really been trying to figure out how I can best contribute and give back to this sub, and I've decided to start writing solid DD in my area of expertise.

Basically, I'll list all of the moves I've made, and then you all can do the exact opposite and make money.
BB continuing to disappoint me
Just gonna watch my portfolio continue to bleed out and do nothing
DOW above 34k

NASDAQ above 14k

S&P500 above 4.1k

We bullin’
Was up 3% on PLTR yesterday, and didn't take the money and run away from that piece of shit.

Shame on me....
Most people here have a super heavy tech portfolio? Out of my 19k in stocks about 10ish is tech?
Fuck TLRY
Oh PLTR, I just can't quit you.  Just hold me nice sometimes though, yeah?  I know not today, but maybe tomorrow?
They call us retail cause we be carrying all these bags

Theta gonna eat me alive
After drinking since close,I've got the clarity to realize the same thing I realized all day. I'm kinda retarded
Sigh! 

No cigar today after what RIOT and PLTR did to me. See you folks behind Wendy’s.
Guys, please thank zjz for clearing the gme spam... 

Mods need some loving, butt touching and caressing.
The ultimate YOLO is putting your entire net worth into a stock and then cryogenically freezing your body for 100 years — hoping that both someone will eventually be able to reanimate you and your investment went 100,000X.
I’m the only dumbass not making in this market
CORN is a growth stalk
Got the vaccine. I can feel the 5G coursing through my veins.
Checking back in again on this shithole of a community. where the fuck are the options? Where are the FD's? what has this place turned into? People posting their portfolios and asking if clean energy ETFs are a good long term hold? this shit sickens me. its literally turned into /r/investing and theres so many of you braindead GME retards that no one even knows we've become the very thing you sought to destroy. 

&#x200B;

Thank you for listening to my ted talk. will be back in a month to remind you that you ruined the best community on reddit. fuck you all
Wowzers that was a bad day for me daytrading TSLA.
There is no "behind" my Wendy's: it's in a mall parking lot. I do my dumpster business in the full view of man and God alike.
unreal NASDAQ making new ATH and my portfolio making new lows
Lol welp, that was fun today, but I like this money printing dog thing
Rumor: DKNG NFL deal
Can’t wait for PLTR to disappoint me for the 5th day in a row
Any reason why green energy dump today?
Spy 420 baby!
BAC 4/16 call gang check in
palantir i am once again asking you to pleas fly again
I honestly have no idea at this point
Draft kings. See you bitches on the moon!
I think you might be on to something with the stonks only go up shit. Pretty much the most exact financial advice you could get in the last 12 months
Rotation from down 15% to down 25% today
AAPL 135+ tmw
Pltr is just a crack rock and we are all chasing that 10 bag we got the week after IPO
Every non mega tech stock has the same 3 month chart
Why don’t we just start our own stock exchange?
SPY 420.69 on 4/20 looks very possible

going to buy $420 worth of edibles at my local dispensary if it happens
Tomorrow or Monday looks like when we start the next leg up for TSLA. Everything I've seen still looks very bullish to me on this stock and I'm still shooting for a profit point of 850ish this month.
In January I bought dirt cheap TLRY calls and made a quick 500% on a run from $8 to $38

today I am just a few bucks from being back to 0 YTD . Enjoy !
Now more than ever need a Tesla miracle AH or in premarket tomorrow. Honestly, what’s happened to the EV market? EV bulls fucked for the year or what?
Going to hold my $MVIS babies
SPY 1% away from 420. Let's make it a fun Friday so we can smoke joints in the evening.
So sick of the people on CNBC saying that we're at "all time highs." We are SUPPOSED to be at all time highs. This is progress into the future, it's not linear, but on average it'll always be all time highs.
I just want one crazy futures night, for old times sake.

I don't even care which way. Give me +6%. Give me -6%. Whatever. I just miss those old days of shitposting on WSB at 3AM with people losing their fucking minds.

The year is 2100

There are over 1000 different growth technology companies that have rallied 1000% every day for a year straight. The amount of wealth in the world is enormous

#I'M BLEEDING TO MUCH TO MAKE MOVES
To be successful in life I think you’ve got to generally *not* be retarded, and I have a lot of problems with that
if you lost money today you are too invested in memes and/or small caps
Just saw the crypto is banned again. Fuck yes u/zjz I'm happy about this! R.I.P. 4/14 to 4/15 Good riddance
The balls I have holding palantir calls, knowing I rely on green futures for 5 days in a row in order to rally 4%
My move is to watch every new retarded ask it a 0.5% movement is market manipulation, and complain when their 80% OTM FDs are deteriorating more quickly than their future.
BB MAKES NO SENSE!!!!
If you wake up in the middle of the night for no reason and you don’t check futures then you need to leave
Calls on Social Unrest this summer
Who’s bag holding TLRY wit me
Proud of myself for hedging for once. My lucid $21 puts are up 90%. Covered calls up 30%. I’ll ride em out and dump the profits straight back into shares.
Staying the fuck out of Chicago, that's gonna powder keg tomorrow.
What’s the most beat up stock recently that honestly doesn’t deserve it?
[removed]
bought some GME 185 lotto tickets before close

those retards are annoying but i'll be damned if their 4/16 holy grail hits and i don't get a piece
Any1 buy BiDU dip 

Just
Me ?
To think that QS was 142 at one point
SPY has now found synchronicity with the date. 415 on 4/15, 416 on 4/16, etc etc until 420 on 4/20
Thank you RBLX for fucking my puts, tf
Gunna start loading up on ice futures cuz of global warming
My Tesla 0dte $730 puts are not lookin good. Probably shouldn’t have yolod my whole portfolio
wish i didn’t know what being in shambles felt like
If you’re not in overvalued large cap stocks right now you’re getting fucked.
No better feeling in the world then when you time the absolute bottom of an option before it bounces. Am I right?
My home state of Massachusetts is trying to ban Robinhood. Fuck this state, it’s the only state in the country that banned fireworks.
PENCILS DOWN 420 tomrrorw
Tomorrow, market may go up or down.
Watch my calls bleed dry again
[deleted]
Lick some door knobs because I got my second pfizer today
Meme speculative shit is out, boomer shit like AAPL or MSFT is in
Conclusion: palantir otm 2023 calls
Holy shit my 4/19 $420 calls might print. 

*Owen Wilson* Woooooooooow
Anal swelling causes

Anal swelling can have a number of causes. Most of them aren’t concerning but some can be serious. See a doctor immediately if you have:

rectal bleeding that won’t stop

severe pain

fever

anal discharge

Typical causes of anal swelling involves owning shares of RIDE, PLTR and BB.
AAPL 140c for next week?
If DKNG doesn’t go up now with that announcement,
I’d hold. Gonna jump in on riot tomorrow. Got Mara right now
Can someone who didn't eat dirt as kid tell me if TSLA goes up or down tomorrow?
Apparently I forgot I'm supposed to inverse WSB. The half of my watch list that is mentioned on here is red. I'd feel worse if I didn't know this place pissed off a few billionaires.
DKNG is now an NFL partner. Calls on the way up.
Look at digital assets, collectibles, real estate, stocks, medical bills, etc. and tell me inflation is 2%. That "calculation" is outdated.
ASO fell asleep, BB is slumping, and RIDE out here finding new 52wk lows as soon as I jump in lmao.  At least I got out of RKT ahead and never tested the PLTR waters lol.
Anyone else holding huge positions in SPACs and got murdered ?
I paper handed QS puts earlier today for a 60% loss and if I  would have held them for another few hours would have been at a 100% gain ama
Buying spy puts feels like quitting caffeine, breaking up with your long term and burying your dog all at the same time.
NIO calls wicked cheap right now
It feels like we are just repeating the same market sentiments we had exactly a year ago. Everyone pile in to the safe large cap boat. Then give it a few months and we will be throwing money back in speculative stocks because this is the new paradigm. It’s a feedback loop where the red is small and temporary leading to higher highs.
So if tomorrow is red, what will happen to speculative stocks who lost 10% today
Just remember when you’re losing someone else is winning
I plan on consulting a plastic surgeon to see if it were possible to get Bill Hwang’s balls.
I made so much $$$ today on SPY I'm about to head over to r/TittyDrop to celebrate.
QS... This short seller is shady as hell.  Avoided answering any important questions.
Ya’ll ready for SPY 420 at open tomorrow?
If Apple doesn’t shoot up tomorrow I’m gonna have to intervene.
PLTR is utter shit, no doubt. But, fuck if these calls aren’t on a firesale. A 23/25 call spread is worth the cost of the trade. Risk 2k for 6k? Ok, I’m in.
PLTR gang, hope things bounce back for y’all.
Nio prediction tomorrow?
Spy calls on the morning dip. T

Well be st like 418 eod. Slight pull back Monday 417. 

Tuesday 4/20 420
I’m baffled that so many of you retards have 500k+ accounts
Man. I am so worked up after looking at these lines for the entire day and now looking at futures. I need to fucking stop. Just came back from gym, had nice dinner, but back to looking at these squiggly lines.
Haven’t jerked it in 4 days since I got the vaccine. Usually religiously rub one out once a day. I feel fine, but PP just not in the mood. Science bros, explanation?
i got turned off from this sub because of GME about a month ago...

I check this sub again today, and its all GME wtf.

I am so sick of seeing the same shit being posted over and over again about GME
Who is holding PLTR?
Today the market ripped, and I was down bigly. I have more wrinkles on my face than on my brain.
Well at least tsla finished green
The [$Coin bags](https://i.imgur.com/pwHzXL1.jpg) are heavy.
Stare at all my calls and question why i am the way i am
my shit needs a proper rebound next week because holy fuck this bleeding cant continue
grab your $RKT ticket now in after hours, she's gonna be fun tomorrow
Put 1K into the slot machine last night and now up 35%. Feels good to be back
There will be a shortage for ROPE if PLTR doesn’t gap up tomorrow...
Q S looks like maybe a buy but I’m scared af
Study shows that holding PLTR will reduce life expectancy by 23.00 years
Ever have a good week where you made some decent plays but more importantly you made some that were REALLY fucking stupid in hindsight and somehow there was like this brief window you were magically able to break even and get out.

That's your guardian angel lookin' out.
oh man you're so fucked
DKNG! What’s happening???
i'll be doing the usual, making 6 or 7 good plays and then 1 collosal fuck up that cancels out any gains
Going tits up tomorrow unless a miracle happens
Just sell puts on small cap you can’t lose
I just welcomed DKNG to my bag collection
SPY 420 by 4/20
So is weed at the bottom or what?
Y’all can thank me for DKNG going up, I sold my calls that I was down 1300 on today at the lowest point
I am not confident at all about tomorrow, which usually means it’ll be a good day
Alexa play fuck Kevin Durant
Spy please cross 420 tomorrow
NASDAQ +1.31%. My portfolio +0.13% :(
OI on SPY 4/20c $420 is over 11k....99% of them are fucking retarded morons in this sub playing the 420 lulz....including me.
I like CNBC is siding with more regulation on trades..... like it’s suppose to help the little guy .....these people suck
Down 36% all time, happened in one month. Thinking I just need a break to chill and stop making blind trades
You ever just feel like the world's moving a little too fast for ya. Idk when I was a kid it just felt like stuff moved a lot slower. Anyway SPY 420 4/20 for president.
Finkle is Einhorn, Einhorn is Finkle!
[deleted]
I bought Spy puts and I’m already down. This is the usual stuff
my long term holdings: let me take you to new heights 

me buying spy puts the last week: no
Is there anything more annoying than up big in pre market then stock dips later in day ?
Show me on this doll where did PLTR hurt you
i would like to say that my PLTR is green—but it’s not
Can't wait for GME to start using terms like "disruptive innovation" and "paradigm shifts".

While still selling their mini squirtles for $20
The dude shorting QS won’t tell CNBC how much he’s shorting and whether he covered today as the stock plunged.
So today we saw a rotation from the smaller hyper growth plays and basically every other sector into tech and SPY.
Do we hate PENN here
Buying QS tomorrow just because that guy on CNBC sucked.
NIO is a painful road
Let's say there's 40 Billion dollars worth of Russian debt trying desperately to sell right now because of the sanctions. What can Russia do? Anyone else wonder what would happen of they dumped some of their $125+ Billion dollars worth of gold reserve to help their economy?
Hey lady. My balls have high short interest, wanna squeeze?
GME thread be like: how to margin call ryan Cohen???
Sold SPY calls at the right moment.

I keep buying TLRY and it keeps going down.  I mean I know it‘s not worth $60 (yet) but *$17*? ! That‘s criminally lower than its $25 rating.  **Where are the 4/20 stock fluff pieces *media*?**
I expect you to die, mr bond
holding aapl never felt so good. c'mon timmy let's ride
BCRX, PSFE, PLTR, and G N U S.
Tomorrow is 4/16 which is 1/4 is which is 25%

Tomorrow is gonna be a 25% day.
Dwight Schrute: What about that business meeting.. to discuss... finances..

Angela: Yes.... *whispers* (but dont expect any cookie)
NKLA was the ultimate P and D

Down roughly 90% from ATH LOL
I bet tomorrow a bunch of stocks will go up and down
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck the entire EV sector
 feeling like a professional peak buyer rn. Oh well
Lost 2 grand this past week.. made it immediately back on SPY calls today thank you inflation.
At this point, I should’ve been trading digital currency
I’m only here to tell you mf that my crush said she liked me back
My heart goes out to weed gang here   You guys don’t deserve this
Fuck you TSLA you POS my $735c 4/16 are worth garbage now
[deleted]
Fuck Tesla
tlry you piece of shit trash. fuck yourself into oblivion
pltr better moon tomorrow held onto 4/16 calls like an idiot
Nice recovery at the end. All in all a great week
Im on tilt
Glad some of you made money today while I got banished to the shadow realm..
I think stop losses strategy is the biggest fraud strategy, basically you are telling algos your game plan, algos sees them, take them out and reverse right after taking out all the stop losses especially mine.  I'm talking to you mini futures. ..
Never been so frustrated with a super green stock day. I ended up with most of my stocks  up 1.5% and all calls up at least 15% but I had 3 stock lose over 8%. Finally just pulled out half my stock to buy it after it finishes burning itself to the ground. Also stopped bagholding my 40 RKT and 28 PLTR to buy a call that ended up a whole 15$ up. At least in death they will serve.
Watch the candle dance while I regret my life choices.
Why does SPY’s price match the date?
#ITS THE LAST FUCKING DAY OF THE CALL I SOLD ON GME. THANK FUCKING GOD.
Bought otm 1dte TSLA puts like a true retard :(
Holding these 4/16 416s. Tmw we ride or die
Do we even consider this a HYLN dip anymore or is this just a slow death?
can't wait to stare blankly at a wall in a darkened room again tonight, everything is fine
Woah DKNG after hours!! Wtf
What's up with DKNG?
Dkng news?
Omg Draftkings bag holders are finally getting paid
I just keep losing money ever since getting out of GME, just gonna pull it all out and buy a Tesla with my earnings fuck it
There's not even one day to think about positioning. Nasdaq reverses on a dime
I actually had a green week. And not because I dumped more money into my portfolio. And not just $5 or something but near a grand...and I feel numb. Its weird. When I'm losing, I go through a range of emotions. I thought I'd be happy or something. I'm just staring at the number like...ok, what now?
i'm still bullish on VIAC , undervalued at $39, optimistic my call will payoff
Watch my portfolio slowly fade into a margin call
Anyone want a slightly used Dow 33k hat?

Gotta get a 34k now
that QS hit piece was fuckin fire dude quantumscape is cringe owning QS is cringe
I recall back in the froth of the GME days, NBC brought on a literal teenager that went to Cornell to talk about his stock picks. He picked SPCE.

Is it too much to ask, for UWMC to hit $12 tomorrow?
Well, I’m going to sell a lot tomorrow and change my investments.
If I lose less tomorrow than I did today I'm calling myself a professional.
The only thing I’m salty about is not putting more money into SPY calls and leaps, what an amazing month April has been
Look at appl barcoding
Mother fucking $AMD god bless your sweet little heart!
The only thing I care about tomorrow is watching DFV rightfully exercise those deep ITM calls. Man deserves what's his.
Watch PLTR bleed down all down like EVERY FUCKiNG DAY
Are the le redit apes being serious when they complain about MaRkEt manIpuLation and that gme is acting unnatural?  Like wtf do they think they’re doing?
watch.

wait.
Why are markets going red now?
Thumbs up if you are still holding from the days as DEAC for dkng. 1000 shares @ 12.49 avg.  I may just hold this for 10 years on autopilot. All I gotta do is let our fantastic CEO crush it and earn tendies in the background.
WSB, a neverending exercise in questioning what you read.
Can my employer find my Reddit acct? If so I’m fucked if they look at recent comments
Same thing we do every day pinky, loose money
Youre not considered a bear if you buy cheap otm puts with your calls. Please do us a favor so we dont have to hear you retards scream bloody murder on the next .5% correction
Reading investing books and learning about the market lost me money. Buying stupid shit is obv the way to go. Kinda discouraging tho ngl
4/16 DKNG 65c was the first option I ever bought and was down 95%, if it goes ITM tomorrow on this news I'll feel like a stonk king
How my APHA brothers doing?
Plug is fucking me
I am really getting tired of seeing BB red
Mara your moms a hoe!
On a mission to make the 4300$ I lost from spy back with only 2200$ left. Wish me luck!!!

GUH
TIL there's a startup called "Figma". What an unfortunate name. It's like fingering a ligma.
Fucking DKNG why do I have extended hours trading if no one is gonna sell me any shares
Don’t want to jinx it but, theta gang in shambles?
Pizza stone was the best thing I ever bought.
It's hard not to laugh at everything and everyone. 

Bloomberg, WSB, me, my friends who held the shiba inu when I sold to buy weeklies.

Fate truly loves irony.
AAPL will run up to earnings / product launch.  It may rocket after that. It may dump. But you bet your hairy ass it will run up.
GO AAPL!!
Bro euphyllia is the biggest pussy of a coral I swear
TSLA?
Ok futures matter now
Sorry guys futures are down I bought today
If you average down long enough, the last shares are free... right?
I am going to load up on EDIT, CRSP, NTLA and BLUE because of this brand new MIT discovery that promises to make CRISPR-Cas9 technology much safer https://news.mit.edu/2021/switch-crispr-gene-editing-0414
this 2nd dose is kicking my ASS
Anyone else accidentally buy calls expiring way too soon because you forget that it’s already the middle of april
Fuckin PLTR man. Only gave us one day of hope just to bait us
I miss something? A certain meme coin is wildin out.
Went from -20% to +80% on my QQQ calls. Locked in the gains. Gonna sleep well
Pelosi feeling good with her RBLX rn
Told myself I’m not drinking a single beer tonight... I have been drinking way tf too much lately like the rest of us. so far so good
You ever feel like you literally don't deserve to make money? Me rn
I don't know about everyone else, but I had a blast playing both sides of the 4/16 options chain for MARA and RIOT today.  Rode them both down on ATM puts and a little after lunch, I rode atm calls back up.  Left a couple 39c's on MARA and a couple 45c's on RIOT for tomorrow morning.  I can honestly say it was a genuinely fun time!  I didn't plan it...it just sort of happened...and it was fun as hell.  Up about 250% on those today.  Everything else flattish or maybe down a little.  Hopefully tomorrow is the same.
Calls on strip clubs?

$RICK
How the fuck is the dog 20 cents right now. We are living in a simulation.
Pltr is shit stock, no matter how many times I avg down, shit tanks further
Hey, what if the GME people had their own subreddit?

Wait, they do? Then why are 95% of the WSB front-page posts all GME related?
Tesla has to go up 20% or I’m gonna be working behind the dumpster at Wendy’s
So basically Nasdaq is green and most peoples meme portfolio is red? Most long term stocks are in the green today. Only trash that have gone up insanely over the last year are in the red badly. This is very much a correction of overvalued companies that price doesn’t match its growth either.  Gotta start making smarter investment choices than yolo plays like fcel plug etc
SPY on pace for $450 in a month and media just acts like it’s totally normal healthy growth
Holy shit Nasdaq up 1.3% and I got raped!  Fuck that was a brutal day.
I think Im going to give up trading and sell covered calls on meme stocks till the kids run out of allowance
NIO will REBOUND tomorrow and throughout the next week to the $45 resistance... remember this comment.
Every “analyst” a month ago: “sell tech.”  Tech skyrockets in last month. What a joke.
Glaring at TSM
MERICAAAAA, F yeah. Coming To save the mothafckn day YEAH.
Get crushed by FUBO some more.
So where do I buy SPY 420 hats?
Probably buying back the spy call I just sold
Spy closed at 415 and today is 4/15. Spy 420 4/20 is happening
Fuck it holding these 416 4/16s. Ride or die
What’s clne doing?
You’re all welcome, picked up SPY puts yesterday, sold my calls(410 and 412). Still think the puts might print(6/18 400p)
Bought spy calls at 930 sold at 12. 60% profit. Bought spy calls 30 min before close. Up 30% at close. Can’t be this easy right?
As you all know, I have uninstalled Robinhood and Fidelity and will be clean for the next 6 months. I have not checked my accounts at all today (all in TSLA), but instead vigorously masturbated to a picture of daddy Elon taped to my bathroom window.  Takes the edge off.
All this 420 4/20 talk sure does seem like a inverse wsb sentiment play.
Rkt
I get drunk and oversubscribe to the wsb comment section and if I don’t make a killing, I’ll be a fool. A fool with a lot of comments on wsb
Im ready for the 75% down yolo the rest
SPY420 is not a meme I’ll be dropping my last 1k on it
I'm considering a hefty APHA position. Probably should have done it today to be honest
SPCE calls because these bags ain’t heavy enough already.
If small caps don't moon tomorrow...
Donkey Kong with the girthiest green dong AH
Same
I had 265,000 of them that would be worth 60k right now but I was like yeah this is a meme and I’m dumb for owning it

Instead I’m sitting here picking my ass and looking at PLTR be red every day.
Silver lining I guess is you keep coming up with a way to afford 7.
I hope you feel better tomorrow dude. When I’m having a shit day, I don’t even fight it anymore, because I found that I would just end up spiraling into a worse mood. I just call it a day and go to bed early. Usually wake up feeling a lot better. 


I mean fuk u
Priced in
Palantir probably will cure cancer by analyzing large swaths of healthcare data
I’m down 5 percent... i’ll be ur hooker
DKNG is one of the things I picked up shares on and forgot I owned.  Never bet against the degeneracy of the american public
You have too much tech?
That seems to be the case for everyone. I’m afraid of getting wiped out when the market turns red.
Agreed. Sometimes you just gotta sit back and chill
Those are the worst. I feel like I’m in the beginning stages of that beginning again.........
Long $ROPE probably
Fuck you mean. AMD balled out
I've got plenty of shit that isn't talked about on here in shambles as well

Never underestimate my ability to find new opportunities to lose money
Need that day to be like tomorrow
Everything will be okay, buddy.
Pull out for that tax writeoff
You have sunken too much cost into it. Your only option now is to buy out the entire company.
Same for my $14...its is now $12. Rip
Worst part is if I find 5 dollars on the ground I'm still over the moon. Up or down several thousands though? Meh.
PLTR, right?
You uh got a link for that? So that I can know what to avoid in the future of course.
Yeah I remember when I was happy too
Have you tried doing the opposite of what you think is right ?
Wait for the crash
Renting is so cheap right now. Probably because everyone is trying to buy and also residual COVID affects. I’ll stick to renting cheap and saving.
don't say that, you'll hurt little timmy's feelings and their 3.2 shares FOMO'd at the peak
this guy gets it.
Still 21% to go

That you don't walk alone. $18k in unrealized losses so far.
Moms have to say that stuff
Are you in middle school
To hit 420 4/20 duh
The only thing that ever made sense to me was when an IB trader told me 80% of his work is luck the other 20% is cheating.
damn i wish i could shoot the shit with you about coral but im a freshwater guy
Must be the 5G. Tell me if you have a sudden urge to invest in MSFT.
i totally forgot i had a few thousand in my old robinhood account and got $2500 worth sitting in there.  Like finding an eightball in a winter coat pocket.
free dumpster food a nice perk
Well of course. Everything is fine. Totally normal. Bull market. Not propped up at all why would you even ask that.
So, -10%
This can’t be legal.

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread ("Commentposting")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for "proof or ban". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... "special".

Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

You owe money just to be broke. Beautifully retarded

congrats and fuck you
I always wondered what Hundred and Ten Percent looks like.
Can always be worse.  Could have been -$23
the extra 22.7 you managed to lose really did it for me, i'm proud of you
SPY $420 on 4/20

bb what is you doing
This is why I visit this sub, so I can feel fine about being down $8k
You got extra credit!
So, you executing that call?
How do people not stress when this happens? Do they not have to pay that money back? Does it not affect there credit? What happens if I lose 1 mil on margin ?
I think you won. Eat some extra crayons today.
*slow clap*
Now that’s a lot of damage.
"How much is it?"

"It's free"

"I can't afford that!"
Spy puts leading to negative account balances; the old wsb I love is back and retarded as ever.
This is why I'll never buy puts
See you next week!
Guh
You're winning, you never hit 0. So you can keep going.
All that money turned to dust
dude, me to today lost all, hope all ok future :(( its scarry tings
You gotta make money just to be broke
I love this place.
I present to you, an ascended retard!
I think you meant to buy spy calls. Oh well, next time!
Looks like you have some "Free Stock" you can get up in that right corner! Dust off your balls and jump back in.
Does that mean you lost your "free" stock share also? :)
Why is anyone still using robinhood?

“But the economy is fucked why is it going up!?” You should have placed puts on your mum. Coz she’ll be going down on me to pay for your dinners my saaan!
How does no one ever learn. You don’t win on spy puts, retards
How do you go negative on an option? I thought you could only lose the price you pay when your option becomes worthless
I wondered if this was possible. Well done retard
SPY puts just tie things together nicely...
Look at this guy giving a hundred and ten percent!
Imagine putting $23,000 into Robinhood.
RH really is a retarded brokerage. I use Etrade mostly and I received a margin call today for $2k when my Live Account value is a large multiple of that amount.
Possibly the most retarded question of all time but here it goes: If fucktards keep losing money in the market, could this theoretically cause deflation? Losing money in the market is taking currency out of circulation correct? Please be easy on me for being a tard
:o
You must have leveraged up to your Personal Risk Tolerance.

Why would you buy a spy put I'll never understand
Guess you should've stuck with GME
rumour has it that if you go low enough you'll see Ludacris appear on your phone.
It is if u don't fucking gable with borrowed money you fucking r tard
You are correct. Putting your money in RH is the lowest you can go.
go for the high score
How does this work to make you negative and how will they get those funds from you?
At least the green breaks up the orange
How can you get negative ?
seeing posts like this makes me glad my broker only gave me Level 1 options...cant do shit with em without an arse stuffed full of cheese
Below the floor there is another floor
That’s cuz you have margin account my guy

SPY puts
Holy shit the numbers can go negative?
Hey man, it’s your wife’s boyfriend. Just wanted to reach out and thank you in advance for the amount of sex I’m going to be having with your wife soon.

Congrats. You’ve unlocked the final boss. Good luck.
This is what dreams are made of
I also bought puts
Congratulations

Fat tax return incoming lol
Imagine shorting the SPY during and epic breakout
Buy STONKS
Spy puts end of month not on the tech earnings run up you truly are retarded
HOLY MOLY
My open orders to sell TLRY and APHA at a few dollars above what I bought them for terminated today. So much for my foray into stocks. This shit is not for me. Just going to hold on to them until I die or the company does.
Oh
Can only lose 100% on buying a stock and the OP said hold my beer
See if it lets you go lower.
Lol at the cameco 20$ call. Why not just load up on shares and wait a few years
Should have waited, it'll be down tomorrow. Buy puts at record highs, buy calls at record lows.
Sheeeeeeesh
A fellow Brother.
he gotta pay $22 to be broke
You retards need to get into crypto to gain back your losses.
Oh no
Look at it from the bright side. Now you won't have to wonder what you gonna be eating and blabla la... Ramen next 24 months to make up for the losses
GUH!
fuck robinhood
two negatives make a positive. can you somehow incorporate this ?
Not how...But WHY???
Ouch. I thought my 99.7% was shitty.
Spy doesn't like puts especially in the month of April
U need 22.77 dollars to be broke
Are you a hedgie?
finance majors be like
Way to put 100 and .10 percent into it you try hard
Classic Cameco curse
Damn, time to ask for a refund on those SPY puts my friend.
It is when purchasing shares. The difference is with a share you will most likely not reach zero. YOU can go below zero.
You make me feel better about myself. Thank you fellow ape.
Just turn your phone upside down.
Poor lil bear u didnt even know u wer fuk
They always say give 100 and 10 %
What does it mean if you go into the negatives? I didnt know that was possible. Do you have to pay it back?
Click "Free stock" to be in the green zone again.
You finally listened to your high school teacher and gave over 100% at something you set your mind to. You should be proud. This is an accomplishment.
You better pay my boyz they need to buy drinks on their yates
At least your money isn’t in Robinhood anymore.
Thank you for making me feel better about being down 50% in 3 months.
This is some good investing
thanks for making me feel better
Good job
That is not really zero if you still have something
Now you really should hold till $0
OMGGGGGg
Had he had more time to expiry (say end of month) he probably would have been right
I did the same thing with SPY puts...
. Fuck this rally. 
The first time I've ever been cautiously bearish.
Your doing an impression of Oil!!!
Hold tight mate you still got $960 left to lose!
Dude spy puts have lost a lot for normal guys the last 2 weeks
I’d be too ashamed to post RobinCrook.
Yeah I had zero dollars in my bank and they charged me $35 overdraft 3 fucking times.  So yeah -$105 for me
What a moron
F
Guh
This is what it looks like to fight our almighty hero JPOW. Never fight the FED!
 You gave it 100 and 10 %
You still have a free stock opportunity
Hopefully the free stock is BRK-A
Negative winning is still winning.
It is if you are not a smooth brained ape.
For your own stake stop shorting the S&P
What happened to stonks go up!
This past week is like a kidney stone
Man.....
Man I feel the pain to a lessor extent.
Quick, ensnare friends for free stocks! /s
So your saying I should keep my hedge ? Ok
And I thought I was down bad. Good luck homie!!
At least you can honestly say you gave more than 100%
Keep spy hedge ? Ok got it
You went out with options and I respect that.
You're giving it 100 and .10%! Good job!
Wanna borrow $30?
I just laughed and said “oh no” out loud I am so sorry hahaha
Oh. *Oh no*.
Ouch.
CCJ, I love that stock
Did you reach your “personal risk tolerance”?
Scam
Porcodio hahahaha
I came for the loss porn
Did you use margin ? I have a call debit spread and some how it's reflecting negative when didn't use margin
Bruhh
Addition and subtraction are hard I guess
You’ll never go negative if you stay away from options
Only puts/calls can go below zero though right? I just buy some shares outright and the company tanks, the most that can happen is the share goes to zero? I’m a smooth brain ape though so still learning.
Does he owe money now? How does it work?
bears are always fuk
Sorry 4 the Question, whats the name of that app?
MAKE THAT PULL OUT GAME WEAK
I don’t even understand any of this and I still know you’re fucked-niceeee
Damn. You should start doing YT videos on how to do this.
I was at -$700 before when Robinhood restricted buys on BB, AMC and GME.
Not all hero’s wear capes
If you would have invested whatever you lost into almost any crypto in the same 3 month period, you would almost certainly made massive gains.
-100.10%. Now you’re just showing off. Gratz retard!
Did you steal my phone?
What is the point on betting the s&p is gonna go down? Like honestly who thinks that is going to happen. Like ask 1,000 financial advisors if it’s gonna go down and if any of them say it might go down then that person immediately gets fired. Like I just don’t know what universe that was ever a good idea.
the 17 cents on my RH account looks quite nice compared to this.
Dang , this guy fucks.
You’re fucked
Oh CCJ. I swore it was gonna hit $22 any day...
Still got time, baby
But hey, “free stock.”
Been there done that...
That's what you get for betting against 'murica!
Puts.
A real man
One more day friend, best of luck xD
Could be worse... could be you on Friday.
Remember you're only below zero for the purposes of getting above zero. Learned this from Magic the Gathering.
Why in the world would you buy spy puts I was bullish the last two months because of something I won’t explain but so much so I bought spy and apple Lol big return this month
You hold!
M.O.O.N. That spells negative returns!
You belong here
I wish I understood options!
Just ignore it. It’s probably about your cars warranty expiring. Put that warranty money into more FDs
Margin just wants to give you the goodbye kiss of doom
Spy puts are always good for some loss porn karma
Fuck. This is why I'm not into options. Too smooth a brain. I'd be deeper in the hole than my wife's boyfriend.
You see you forgot that the usd inflating. Can you guys help me identify thing that cost 30% more than there pre covid price?
First thing I thought when I saw this picture. 

“Ahh SPY puts, masters of loss porn”
Spy puts is the opposite to an be an ape
to be fair, spy suddenly spiking to 410+ meant spy 410p' arent a bad play at all.

problem with puts is the timing is super difficult. when market drops it drops hard so puts can go up 1000%+. getting far dated puts can work but market goes up in the long run so playing puts is just generally difficult.
I spy with my two eyes, someone whose IQ is not high.
Hint: SPXL puts
I am another one. Waiting for that final blow that'd put me good night
I feel so bad for how well my calls are doing.
Guh
Took out 2. Luckily I’m still up but damn I coulda bought so much blow and hookers if I never bought spy puts.
i actually make money daily on spy puts, very short term though....as in like 20 min holds mostly
Had to take a screen shot of this post with your comment for my own retarded friend who did the same thing as OP, same amount, but in 2 weeks instead of 3 months.

He might have finally seen the light.
Remember spy 200 puts?
I say. I was always wondering why the fuck would you bet against spy under a competent administration that's addressing the covid issue properly.
I prefer VXX calls.. so it’s almost like you’re a bull but you lose your money just like a dirty bear, best of both worlds really.

I won $50 on a $413c today. 

I hear SPY is risky as fuck. Probably could have waited longer, but I wasn't trying to lose my initial $170.
SPY Puts are the effective eugenics system we've ever invented
STONKS
Why the fuck would anyone ever go for SPY puts? SPY growth is my go-to comparison to see whether I'm actually gaining by trading or if I would've been better off just putting everything in some ETFs.
We just call that overdraft fees.

won't he gain money if he buys?
Even if that was 22k it wouldn't be enough lol
I invested in spy puts, too broke to guild but your comment is rich enough for the both of us.
Like 110%.
Or even *worse*

-$22
Count me in for -$5
I think the call option for CCJ was even more surprising to me lol
Hoping that Opposite Day ran a little longer this year
That’s my current YOLO since Monday. $420 by 4/20, 420 contracts. I thought it lost cause yesterday at -55% but today was a nice 200% jump.
I’m down 2200 and flipping out. Learned options the hard way
Not if the call executes him first. With his current losses, that might be the safest "option".

> What happens if I lose 1 mil on margin ? 

People here have gotten pretty close. Reg T says that brokers shouldn't give more than 2:1 margin but RH has a history of... glitches
If RH is stupid enough to let me go negative 1 mil on margin with my balance, it’s their problem at that point, not mine lol.
They do
Post on Reddit and see upvotes instead. What’s to stress about?
Or long term
[deleted]
Happy cake day!
The balance is negative, ya boi can’t even afford free
I no know no other robinhoods
I think... I think this is when you have a spread with a maximum loss of X.

 It the price moves past X. It shows you lost more than your max loss.  At least that’s what’s happening to me.

Or I fucked up this spread real bad.
Bruh people have millions in rh.
No because the markets are a zero sum game. When one party looses money, another one gains it.

If I sold you a put option for $10 and you never executed it before its expiration, you may have lost $10 but I got your $10 and used it to buy myself trendies so it hasn't been pulled out of circulation.
Not from a wrinkle brain
Haha if I could I would
I get calls about my cars extended warranty every fucking day. I think I’ve gotten a call from almost every state by now. Why is that scam so popular? I mean they’re missing their target audience by a county fucking mile with me. I drive a beat up ‘97 Ford ranger.
people think the point of the market is to get money, the real point is to lose as much as you can and make a loss porn post for karma, cuz karma > money
I've made money on TSLA puts. I've made money on AMZN puts. I have never made money on SPY puts.
Edit: but I have lost 1000's of dollar on SPY puts.
a spy put with a uranium long kicker, it was a bold call cotton
This is the way
I upvoted this but then had to undo it bc it wasnt 69 upvotes anymore.
Legend!
I mean, just do covered calls. You literally can't lose money unless you do something stupid like making a covered call than the price you bought it. The only problem is that you need 100 shares bc that's how much a lot is.
I don’t have nearly the testicles or arrogance to be able to put money on when something might happen. I’ll recklessly gamble on if things will happen, but when? That’s hard af man. Option trading just scares me for that reason. 

I’m a degenerate gambler to begin with, I’d be broke like almost immediately if I fuck with them.

True. I went 1800 Below in robinhood.  It cleared in 1.5 years and they banned me.lol
Ahhh ok. What about shares bought at 420 but then get sold at 69? Where does that difference go?
Because our wonderful government sells our DMV records. 

You know because screw privacy.

I haven’t even made money but I’ve lost thousands of dollars on SPY puts.
So you're saying I should short SPY?
Did you miss the whole covid sell off? SPY puts were free money for a few weeks
the money is in selling spy puts, not buying them on dips
Do you guys making money?
I’ve made good money on SPY puts last (2020) February/March... I was only 6 months into trading and went for it with my full account of $2000 since coronavirus was starting, the puts started printing real nice and got up to $6000... then the FED announced super-easing, puts value went back down to $3000 and I cashed out right there... if I had waited for the next month when they expired I calculated it would have been about $18,000 intrinsic value.

As they say, the first one is always free... I just wish I would have fully ridden my first one out.
Ape here, but I'm pretty sure that you have a word missing there.. and it seems like an important word. And it's a word that I can't fill in on my own.
Why do you hurt me with your truth
Lmao my $80 card I bought used 3 years ago is selling for $200 right now.

Ammo is like 500% up or you first born child.
Sorry, big numbers confuse me
Might want to throw your phone in a lake afterwards just to be sure.
You can call robinhood and they give refund. But only works once a year. And usualy the refund is only 50% of the loss
It's like owing any company money, they can get a judgement against you and garnish wages, bank accounts, maybe put liens on your stuff.

Bankruptcy should be able to help though. Thank God for bankruptcy.

There is every reason to be stressed in this situation though, unless you have lots of money elsewhere.
Clear cache first though
I'll give you a serious answer. No - not for real. You still owe that money
Yup. How are they gonna get their money if you don't have the app to transfer funds to?
"i didn't want to be your friend anyway"
**Initial condition:**

The founder of LULZ inc. has 0.

I have $1.

You have $420.

Mr. Ape as $69.

**Total: $490**

I buy a LULZ share for $1 at IPO.

You buy it from me at $420.

You sell it at $69 to Mr. Ape.

**Now:**

The founder of LULZ Inc. has $1

I have $420.

You have $69.

Mr. Ape has 0.

**Total: $490**
I assume you mean by sucking  dicks.
My mom used to make cash the old fashioned way after I went to bed. No my wife does on the weekends when she has “work” trips.
I’d like to thank you in advance for your donation

I see you too are fluent in the culture.
Get ready for the parts kits to go up now.
Should I change my social and my name to ?
I think you gotta throw the river into the lake for the compound effect to take place
i've had some success haggling with their customer support.  was able to finesse a 100pct return of my loss last time.
So the guy who said to delete the app was bullshiting lol
If you declare 100% of your income to feds, then get it back in a lump sum tax rebate they can't deduct it or take any.  

True story.
Damn... You are a special ed teacher aren't you?... That makes sense, thank you master
Behind the Wendy's naturally.
He said “the old fashioned way”.  Aka “with your hands”. I’m pretty sure that means strictly handys.
Whoring yourself is always the most expedient way to make money.
Is there any other way of making money?
That's the deep penny machine
But I mean, someone's gotta be the first....
This is why r/fosscad
Just set it to private and block RH
That’s great! Personally was able to get my loss on TSLA puts because the costumer service rep drove NIO car.
Yup.
Did you really have to ask that?
Not entirely. Delete the app, then declare bankruptcy
In fairness, if you turned a million dollars into -$22, you probably should delete the app.
Well not entirely if you're fucking yourself out of significant amounts of money you should absolutely delete it. Especially since it's  Robinhood.
I hope you’re fucking joking mate
I have a vagina beard.
Thanks for the financial advice!
Sir, this is an Arby’s.
This time of day the Popeyes is more profitable.
Sir, this is a dick sucking station.
Sir this is a Wen...ah, you understand. Nevermind.
He means your mouth
Mouths are the new hands, at least thats what I tell myself before going to "work".
They don't call it the oldest profession for nothing.
Can confirm this.
Someone’s gotta win the lottery too, good luck have fun
Someone probably did last year, but I’d bet they lost it again trying again
They really are the best company out there for finance.  I ended up consolidating my checking and savings accounts from my credit union into my Robinhood account and now I use their debit card for all of my purchases.  It's so much better.
Username checks out
u/Low_Opportunity268 actually is retarded
He's probably one of those high schoolers from the GME gold rush that everyone talks about.
I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY
I call dibs
I’m confused. 

Is this 

A. A hairy pussy

B. A beard in the shape of a vagina.

Please help me understand
Who said anything about making money?
Sir. ^points ^at ^sign No, It’s still a Wendy’s.
So a highway rest area?
This isn't a lottery?
In case anyone was wondering, yes this is all deep sarcasm.
I get all my insurance through them now too. Car, boat, house, liability. I owe my life to RobinHood™. They basically own my life. I'm thinking of inviting the two founders to my wedding.
A vagina with a beard. Like a ZZ Top beard but on a vagina.
For some it's a profession, for others a passion!
Sir, they are sucking dicks, and we have the meat. This is an Arby’s.
No sir, this is a casino
I was starting to worry my brain had lost its last wrinkle, I was starting to believe it.
Oh wow. I wasn’t expecting that. 


It’s sounds.... terrifyingly intriguing...
damn i tried to think of a comeback lmao
Lmao..that's funny . I work at Arby's...
And we see here, the birth of a new fetish.

Had a dream last night that the price shot up to 634 today, very bullish
I was quick to get an alert that were down 5%, where’s my up 20% alert from yesterday?
I have to go back to work May 3rd (pending MOASS) pros:  I’ll have more cash injection into my GME portfolio/ cons:  they are probably going to want some sort of productivity other then watching tickers and Reddit threads.
Started taking a daily vitamin (for health!) a month ago. Been feeling great. Realized this morning I’ve been taking Women’s once a day but I’m a guy! 

Very bullish.

Okay, normally we need the downvotes bots to be active to do this, but today we feel especially powerful.

How about a random upvote party?

I'm going to upvote the apes.
Holding 21@164. Been averaging down since January.  Never comment. Always upvote. GameStop has more brand recognition than ever before. This stock is the tits. Proud to be with my kind. Smooth-brained ape for life!
Every day, I just keep thinking about how I must be talking to all sorts of apes in here. I even wonder how many are ape doctors... One second, they are like “down with the hedgies!” and the very next second, they are like, “scalpel”.
Just bought 20 more shares!!!!
I plan on buying a home for my family. If I can get a high enough price I've had this dream of starting a charity that pays for people's college tuition, books, fees, etc..., and also pays them a year round stipend so they can consider being a student their actual job.
Own 15 at 214. Feels like I’m forever in red. Can’t average down anymore but I’m holding til the grave.
Idk how much effort Melvin is putting in rn but I'm sitting on my toilet eating nutella breadsticks and I'm on the winning side.
3 months ago today, GME closed at $35.50

We are doing just fine people!
price doesnt matter, trust the DD and wait for the squeeze or GTFO
News and information out of GameStop has been dropping left and right lately. I'm excited for more news that could drop today or through the end of the week. We can still expect the 2021 Meeting proxy documents, and an official press release from gamestop regarding the search for a CEO that Reuters reported. Gamestop is still operating with an interim CFO, so they may still announce a hire for that position. I wonder what other surprises are in store?

GME has a good day yesterday now all the naysaying trolls and bots are back. So obvious, insulting really

Did you hear one about the guy that sold? No? That's cause no one has sold.
DFV tweeting 4 times an hour, 20 times total for 420 baby.  Light it up
I'm not balls deep in GME like a lot of you. But by this point I don't fucking care about the stock's movement. IDK why I bother checking the price. I'm immune to dips and peaks. Anything short of the moass I am numb to. Just holding and waiting for my sell orders to place in case anything rockets.
I’ve been commenting on yesterday’s thread. I belong here.
Anyone else sitting in there car alone watching the ticket waiting for your whole life to change??
Ok media you convinced me to sell because of

\- Amazon Google Chewey Execs being appointed

\- RC being named god of the board

\- GME announcing the search for new C.E.O.

\- GME paying off senior notes

\- DFV exercising (vote per twitter) 50K more shares 4/16

\- The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3.5M shares or $1B in value (285$ per share?)

\- The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting (6/9)

\-  The board holding the CEO and another executive responsible for not performing and withheld $100M in stock bonuses

If GME ends over 500 today I will drink a crayon smoothie
I've averaged up so much you couldn't tell that I still have shares that were $40
It’s just so fucking easy to hold
Anyone else cut back significantly on how much you watch the markets? I’m not selling until either an absurd number in a squeeze, or until I more than double my initial investment if the squeeze never comes because the system is broken, so I stopped watching. I’ll check periodically just to see, but at this point, there’s really no reason for me to look. I have my shares that I will hold, so any small price fluctuations don’t do me any good to watch.

ETA this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor
Sometimes when I’m bored and notice the stock is slipping, I toss 50 bucks at it like it’ll make some huge push to help the gang. I’m retarded.

Sad to see people losing like 8 - 40 thousand on call yolos.. not only did they try to time this but they also missed out on buying a good chunk of stock for the moon mission
I give you guys credit for being on here every day! Hope you make millions.
Just me or is there a different vibe here this evening. FUD spreaders out in full force. Remember what you've learned or miss out
Everyone is alot nicer on here at night

In Ancient Rome, water clocks were commonly used for measuring time by allowing a small, constant flow from a marked vessel. In court, a lawyer’s time for argument was set by a ‘clepsydra,’ which was a vessel that emptied in about 20 modern minutes. If a speaker went over his appointed time, his colleagues would argue that his ‘water should be taken away.’

Time dialation due to this stock has been way stronger than those trips too.

I feel like it's been a fucking eternal journey, but every day disappears faster than it comes around. Goodness me I love this stock.
From 162 to 159 off 10k volume.  Absolutely no one is selling their stock.  

I hope these hedgefunds get fucked royally.
I really appreciate DFV adding to the hype with memes lmao
I bought in at $339 and refuse to average. I am the biggest imbecilic ape with the diamondest of hands.
My buddy has been investing a lot longer than me so I asked him today what he thought was a good exit strategy and he said about $3.50, which was weird as he’s always been really bullish about GME. That’s when I looked closer and realised this wasn’t my buddy at all but a 120 foot monster from the Mesozoic era. 

Stay safe out there guys and be careful who you trust!
I just want to remind everyone to not hype tomorrow up too much. Remember Quad Witching 1 and 2? Remember 3/19?  

DON'T. GET. ATTACHED. TO . DATES. 

With that being said, my tits are jacked.

Its only what i could spare, really not a lot, but anything is better than nothing. 

I like the stock.
Honestly, it's exhausting watching the hedge funds get away with manipulation day after day. You crayon-eaters have given me resolve on the days where it's tough, so it's only right I diamond hands until the fat lady fucking sings at the auction of the HF's foreclosure.
Guys, DFV has been holding this stock for 2 fucking years. GME was 40 in february. GME always raise. Just HOLD. Our time will come.
It appears that tomorrow it is on gentleman

No convincing me he exercised today
I feel like these youtubers who are a part of the reddit community are doing more harm than good at this point. I don't watch them anymore. They keep spreading dates, some spread FUD. Some make money off of reading your guys hard work. I just dont trust them. I trust the real apes that are in here, not them.

 what's with all this aggressive short selling against GME? I think someone doesn't like the stock..
Prolly shouldn’t really buy anymore... but 50 sounds a lot nicer than 44.2

This retard just bought the fucking dip, tendies on clearance today!
These people in power really want the masses to believe it’s over through manipulation of media and stock price. This must have been how every problem was dealt with in the past. Feeling resistance now
All we have to do. 

\-Hold and be Patient

\-Buy more IF you are able to. 

\-Enjoy Memes.

That's all.
Came for the holy, stayed for the moly.
I wish gamestop sells red headband and wrist bands.
10 more at 155.26 doing my part.
I can afford 20 more, but then for real I gotta sit back and diamond hands.
Some thoughts on control.

1. Max pain range was $140 at the beginning of the week
2. Max pain range is now at $150 (option changes)

[http://maximum-pain.com/options/gme](http://maximum-pain.com/options/gme)

This stock is fully manipulated to kill options at the moment thus STOCKS NOT OPTIONS.  
I don't know who's controlling this - but it is COMPLETE control.
I was the buy wall 154 your welcome
Dammit guys I bought another 2 shares... I'm getting dangerously close to 69 shares total
NEW DFV TWEET:

Matt Damon in Rounders.....right as he outbluffed Johnny Chan(former World Series poker champion)
I haven't seen DFV this active in a while something will happen
There is some legit massive bull dick energy flowing through this thread today. Please based god, I ask that you confirm DFV's glorious tweets by giving us a throbbing hulk cock +27% face ripper during power hour
DFV says "more volume" and we say "how high"
Fasting for Ramadan. Guess where extra food money savings are going?
THERE AINT NO PRICE THATS HIGH ENOUGH

AINT NO DIP THATS LOW ENOUGH

THERE AINT NO SPREAD THATS WIDE ENOUGH

TO KEEP ME FROM GETTING TO MOON
DFV giving out tweets every 15 minutes is like Matthew McConaughey’s martini orders in Wolf of Wallstreet
https://twitter.com/TheRoaringKitty/status/1382759375677186050

Did my man just blow his whole stack on more GME?
This mother fucker is gonna bust soon
im in with 28 shares at $159, literally put all my savings on this
Something feels different about today idk why...but I say that everyday
If DFV drops a Yolo update and fires up his stream after hours, it's gonna be hype as fuck!
Honestly fuck work
DFVs tweets have me checking the ticker every 10 seconds.
DFV edging me to death with these tweets....
DFV is building to something, I wonder what it is. Fully expect a YOLO update AH today - I have one upvote and 900 coins to put toward awards for it - make sure you all do the same.
As long as we moon before I get fired...
Is it weird if I ask my girlfriend to wear a red headband in bed?
I can stay retarded longer than they can stay solvent

Bought another. I'm a fucking idiot.
StocksRegister posted an article an hour ago saying GME closed today at 154.07 and -7.48% from previous close.

What the titty fuck? SIte is down right now too lol
If you’re feeling uncertain, or fear, or doubt... remember how many people yolo’d into COIN yesterday
I'm expecting a son in June, if we moon before he is born I will make sure his first word is Gamestop.
"Today is the day. I feel it in my weiner."

Well I guess I'll have to go beat my weiner for being wrong today.
Where were all these trolls yesterday? Curious, isn't ?
Only 7 mil shares traded for the entire day? There’s literally nothing left for them to sell to us lol.
Just saw the Kenny G cameo and idk I think I’m becoming a full ape. If we look at the battle in this sub surrounding GME there’s a group of hateful boomers telling people “you’ll lose all your money!” On the other side we got people donating in record numbers, people gaining hope that they’ll be able to afford a house one day, as well as just good vibes. Looks like it’s time to buy more GME.
Got flaired today. I said “you only get a flair when the mods deem you worthy”
Just waiting for that DFV Yolo update
Imagine if on 4/20, Musk Cohen and DFV all post a video of them smoking together in the RK studio. And they just say “CHEERS EVERYBODY”
I wish there's a GME convention where I could meet all y'all in person.
Robinhood offering 3 stocks for a referral now. They must truly be fucked.
I can’t wait for the squeeze to start so I can say

“Whale, whale, whale, what do we have here”
Guys we just have to turn the system off take the game out and blow in it and put it back in and turn it on. Fixes the freeze every time
DFV is a Fucking LEGEND!  Yes or No?
Wow, working overtime today, interns?

Hope you're getting that time and a half!
Also never forget the S.E.C said they found “no fraud” on the Madoff case and then told congress to pretty much fuck off you’re not our boss after the fact. USELESS

Proof- https://youtu.be/R30HXssXxaU


Even better : Bernie and the S.E.C shared an office on the same floor in the same building in N.Y for over a year.


Do you one better: the S.E.C has their own judges so technically they can legit do whatever the fuck they please under their own scrutiny. They operate outside traditional federal courts. For example daddy musk and Cuban didn’t go into a federal court for their hearing they went to an S.E.C court with and S.E.C appointed judge.
I'm not saying Keith Gills dick is huge..

 I'm saying it beat me at arm wrestling.

So every day, institutional investors and whales buy and sell stocks with the intent of moving the price, and nobody bats an eye. But two people get together on social media and decide to do the same thing, and suddenly we need to hold Congressional hearings and listen to those same institutional investors bitch about how we’re manipulating the market. It’s not a bug to these people that the market is broken in their favor, it’s a feature.
“I’ve listen to preachers, 
I’ve listen too fools.
Im not going to sell them,

picked up 12 shares today. Tomorrow is pay day hoping to acquire another 14
I guess the shorts covered...gonna sell all my shares now ( wink wink)
Started this game at $109, bought more at $232...

Bought EVEN MORE at $46 in mid February, now at an average of $69... I'm STILL +100% and I HEDL at 40....you think I'm going anywhere?!?!

I like my stock.  It is mine now.

My money is on the way boyz, the 9 shares I buy will surely turn things around
Stock usually bumps up when I'm sleeping, so I'm gonna go take a nap. Wake me up when we land on the moon, please!
I FUCKING LOVE EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS.
Haha very funny guys. Now show us the real price.
It’s okay GME, you moon when you want (:
Guys, i've learned about this Stock Market Cheat Code. It's similar to the ones in GTA IV.

If your stocks are flat or losing you money, simply go to your bathroom (without your phone). Take a 9 minute poop. Wipe 4 times. Come back to your setup and you should be up 17%.
If we eat all the red crayons, the stock can only be green. *taps head*
I currently choose to read the price backwards. It's $551

All in all...pretty damn good day so far!
Like zero fud when it was up yesterday and now back in full force when it goes down. Hedgies, we may be retarded, but we aren’t stupid. You use the same tactics EVERYFUCKINGDAY for months on end and think we haven’t figured it out yet?
100% of my liquid assets into GME? Yay/nay?
I bought GME at 205 and dont have the funds to average down yet. Pick me up on the way please :]
Officially at 420 shares on the dot. 

I can't buy anymore lol, I'm tapped out of cash that isn't emergency savings.
just bought 100 more, I like the stock
Who’s still above 200?
Price don’t matter because the price is wrong
Blackrock profit assets top $9 Trillion! They supported Ryan Cohen at chewy and now they in gamestop. This gonna be huge
Just bought 2 more on the dip. Not much but hey, it’s something.

This stock is like an old person in a grocery store. It just wanders around aimlessly, then stops for no reason in the middle of the aisle.
Daaamn, y'all see the SEC  awarded 50mil to whistleblowers today?
If I was the manager of a Gamestop store, I would put a bowl of bananas next to the door with a sign "Welcome Shareholders" 

It would be a fun way to build brand loyalty.
I wanna give a big shoutout to the boy from Bulgaria, without him shutting things down in January I honestly thought that the stonk would only go to 1000$ now the floor is in the millions so thank you Vladdy you the real MVP.
I love how +/- 5% is considered "flat" for GME. :P
Guys I’m getting work done at work today

What have I become
Don't you just love how it takes 2.5x more volume to push the price up, and they still can't kill this stock
[deleted]
My gigantic buy wall (6 shares lol) at $150 is holding strong.
PS5 pattern with dual shock controller forming. Bullish.

Every time I buy the dip it turns into the new floor.... am I doing this right?
Hedgies shoulda put a quarter in their ass, cause they played themselves.
Bold prediction, as the day goes on we will move right
Watch party is getting a little dull. I'm gonna order a pizza. You guys want anything?
It’s ok gme you moon when you want to
for 2 days, i was happy that 140 seems to be the new base for this stonk

now, 155 seems to be a new base

but i prefer $2000k to be the new base TBH :D
 What if the real squeeze was the friends we made along the way?
WE HAVE NO SELL WALLS IN SIGHT!!
Matt DayMoon?
How it started:

0.5 shares, +125%

How it's going:

16.5 shares, -33%

How it's gonna go:

Buy more when I'm paid
So that huge uptick and then dip back to 161 was off of 200k volume only?! It takes hardly any buy pressure to get that ticker up holy moly
DFV ALL IN??

Just got Moderna’d and now I can’t stop buying GME.

Just kidding I’ve always been buying GME.
After DFV brilliant research and play, I think he has now devoted his time to posting the best gifs and videos he can....aaaand of course he’s amazing at that too.
DFV is tweeting in 15 min intervals. Has he always done that???
The post-moon party should be held in Iceland. It's usually very green and pretty there. There won't really be much ice 'til we show up.
I mean DFV never left us but still, bullish

# Massachusetts regulators seek to revoke Robinhood's license; brokerage  sues

Reuters 3:31 PM ET 4/15/2021 - Nate Raymond

>BOSTON, April 15 (Reuters) - Massachusetts regulators on  Thursday sought the revocation of Robinhood's broker-dealer license after  charging that it encourages inexperienced investors to place risky trades  without limits, while the online brokerage sued to invalidate a new rule  underlying the case.

EDIT:  [Massachusetts regulators seek to revoke Robinhood's license; brokerage sues | Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/robinhood-sues-invalidate-massachusetts-fiduciary-rule-2021-04-15/)
Some dude on Twitter posted an article, dated from today, saying that GME closed at $154.07, down 7.48%...the fuck...I guess we will know if this shit happens. The article was from stocksregister.com
Guys my wife just came in and said it’s over but I’m looking now and it’s going back up again? Could she be looking at a different market or something?
We need a whale attack
Yeah, so, if this ends at the prematurely published 154.07 cost...I'm gonna need to up the floor on your cost Ken to at least 100 million.
It is definitely about to close at $154.07 and if that happens I am filing an SEC and FINRA complaint.
**OPEN THE GODDAMN CASINO!**
Would have been riots if that thing closed at 154.07.  I wonder why that number was picked.
I see no reason to sell. If the stocks worthless (which it isn't) then there's no reason to sell it. If it's worth alot, why would I sell it??
Morale up everybody. 
I'm not going anywhere - here with all of you.
Well the negative Nancies are here again, right on time
What do the mysterious tweets from DFV mean today??? He kept posting videos of clocks pointed to 12. Then proceeded to tweet every 12 minutes all day. Wtf does it mean?!?!!
Immune to these dips, wasn’t even big today, *yawn*

Friendly reminder, being bored isn’t a reason to sell.  Trust the DD, this will moon, and it’ll moon hard.
Damn everyone is acting extra FUDy. Only DD you need is dfv and the institutional and retail ownership keeps increasing
Bout to smoke a blunt and go to Gamestop
Tomorrow is the quadruple bears, hedgies, shorts and Cramer Max pain fucking hour

anyone in the mood to rage buy tomorrow?
Jacked for tomorrow. Feel like getting one of those old timey bicycles with the big ass front tire and jumping the Grand Canyon. I’ve naturally achieved coked up status through GME!
April 16, 2021 will forever be known as ***DFV DAY***
I’m up here at 265$ can’t wait to see the rocket up here again
Got to Avg down to $177.68 today from $258.30. Feels so good
CNBC talking GME now
Friendly reminder to not get so attached tomorrow. There’s still the likelihood that nothing happens tomorrow and we still wait weeks/months for the squeeze.
Stonks
New DFV tweet! AH tweet = bullish
So $155 is the new $140? GOT IT
After Hours DFV tweet? Bullish!
Where are my AH apes at?!?  I need my evening fix of positive vibes after all that edging DFV did today.

DFV exercising his options will not move the price or cause a pop. It will only happen if you all continue go buy and hold.
I think I'll buy more gme today
Keith Gill and Kenny Griffin, both K and G in their names and they are on opposite ends of the spectrum.  Tis a sign to BUY!!!!

Picked up another 2 shares.  GME is a drug.
My autism causes me to buy even numbers of GME shares at even prices.
I just wish Blockbuster was here for us right now
Its funny that when my 2 other baby stock's price decreases and are -15%, i get a little mad at them and close my eyes for 3sec to take a deep breath. But when gme gives me -55% before, it didnt concern me at all and even bought some additional ammo. I think its time to turn my portfolio to 100% GME to avoid this madness.
u/OPINION_IS_UNPOPULAR, I hope I see another update to Good Mevening Everyone for the after-hours vibe peeps.
This stock is a slutty tease. This is why I keep throwing money at it, pretty sure
Boss makes a dollar I make a dime that’s why I buy GME on company time !!
Do you ever feel like GME is like Santa’s sleigh in the movie Elf? Where if more people believe in it the more power it has to fly? No? Just me? Ok...
Apes getting excited because the price went from -7% to -5%... I love you retards.

The manipulation is boring
Takes millions in volume buys to bring the price up. Low volume sells drive the price down. Sus.
#it is so easy holding until the moon.
The tendieman is never late, nor is he early, he arrives precisely when he means to
So... Plates for Lambo: **DF V12**    Any thoughts??
Can’t wait for DFV to post his positions after market today and get hype train super charged and primed to the tits.
If these fuckers intended to cover they would’ve done it the first time they got it down to 40. They never intend to cover until they are forced. We need 801 to stop their infinite money cheat code.
Just bought 5 more at 155.70. Every little bit helps
Out of ammo, added 3 shares, resupply tomorrow...COVER ME!
My guess is we are flat until 3est and then we shoot up on proxy announcement. DFV will exercise, which technically won't do anything, but apes will see he bought more and they'll buy more.   


BlackRock, you wana send this thing into outer space?
 I woke up late but I managed to liquidate all my extra positions and now I'm 100% in on GME!
Bought my first share today!!!Woo
I was born to hold.
Man I wish I could have bought this dip the last couple days. Sadly I’m a poor ape that already bought as much as he could.
It's funny you should say that, 'cause today is the day.

That movie was fantastic. The twists were spectacular and the cast was great.
Sneakers is a great movie.
This movie is great.. but the "none of them want to pay taxes again.. ever" from Armageddon is prob the best demand of all time.
I remember the film but I can't remember the name.

This is some quality ass content right here

Great fucking movie!

You apes are on point today. Fucking legends, all of you.

This was one of my childhood's favorite movies.
A house for myself and my sons.  

A house with a yard and a room just for my plants and paints.  I want a garden that I can sit and drink coffee in.  I want to be able to work because I love it (I love being a psych nurse, but it doesn't pay), not because I have to.  

That is all I want.
This is the way.
>the young lady with crayons

lmao
Imagine your natural voice is Darth Vader
I love those niners hats
u/savevideo
The Moon is not in Europe, but Europa is a Moon.

forgive my ignorance, what movie is this ?
Poor River Phoenix.
ZOMG SETEC ASTRONOMY
insert  "Yeah, they had us the first half, I'm not gonna lie" meme
Well played
Can someone explain to a fellow retard how some of the institutional investors still have short positions that haven’t been forced to be covered? Is it because there is no expiration date on put options, unlike call options? Why wouldn’t they have been forced to close when GME was squeezed and hit it’s last two highest share prices?
 The, young lady with the... Uzi. Is she single?
Such a great movie. Brick choice.
Brilliant!   DFV is solid!
"I'm into to it".
Exellent
Everyone should read "Business Adventures"
This is literally the BEST
BEST MOVIE EVER!  God Bless whoever made this meme!
I proudly joined the ape army today.
This sub has become so cringe. Sad to watch.
What's the name of the movie? I can't think of it. Brain fart ape today
Ken is Darth Vader...who would have thought!
Sneakers, if you haven't seen this movie WATCH IT.    


Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, James Earl Jones, Ben Kingsley, River Phoenix, Mary Mcdonnel.... Seriously WATCH THIS MOVIE it's amazing.
he was a mute for years. dude has seen some shit.
Proof

[https://youtu.be/RaZyxCAYuoc](https://youtu.be/RaZyxCAYuoc)
For real, all I hear is Darth Vader while watching this.
Morgan Freeman I think.
Ummm Julie Andrews actually but okay
Plus he was an Army Ranger!!! Pretty bad ass to me.
Remind me the movie please.
Imagine listening to him and Morgan Freeman at the same time. Ears would explode.
Sneakers, highly recommend it
11/10 movie. One of my all time favorites.
Yes, do yourself a favor and watch it. Still a great movie.
This was before he became president in the Cylon Wars
Man, I need to re-watch *The Sting*.

And *Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid* for that matter.

And now we're getting off of Redford, but *Cool Hand Luke* too...
Yes
The most
Dictionary definition of women want him, men want to be him
This was a good one. Rolling, I swearz!
Does it have highly realistic and accurate scenes like dialing into NORAD with your modem to play a game of global thermonuclear annihilation, or tic-tac-toe with WHOPR??
There were a lot of nods to phreakers with names like Whistler, Mother, etc.
I think the movie is called Sneakers
Thanks, I spent the past few days trying to get it just right
Not a deepfake, just old footage from before he was First Lady during the alien attack
Was just watching Sneakers the other day and when it got to Akroyd asking for the Winnabego I knew it had to be done
Just bought more shares
Well, try 867-5309. Ask for Jenny. I hear she is looking for a good time.

Sneakers.
Sneakers. It’s amazing go watch it now
What why?
Sam Elliot would be great 3rd place
This makes my day
Don’t forget

https://youtu.be/i739Gx2q6Ak
Doesn't beat this

https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ
Denzel
Not the only PBS programming he did. Remember Long Ago and Far Away?

[https://youtu.be/oVvWodDCbjM?t=43](https://youtu.be/oVvWodDCbjM?t=43)
Morgan Freeman is probably a good second place. No shame in that, but he ain't beating Darth Vader and Mufasa.
Sneakers. Great movie.
Easily the best hacking movie.    

I want a Winnebago
Excellent, excellent film. How’d I forget Dan Aykroyd was in it?! Guess I have to rewatch...
Doubling - no, tripling - that recommendation. Watch it, and you will know where to find the healthiest diet ever. Truly.
Aw Yiss! Sneakers, need to rewatch that one right away!
Cattle mutilations are up.
Way ahead of its time (1992)
It won’t load on HBO max. I’m convinced enough of us are trying to watch this that it’s having a hard time.
I leave message here on service but you do not call
Gotta fuck up them toasters
Did not realize how fuckable she, I mean he, was.
The castle     It's a good underrated one
The Sting is my absolute favorite
Ah War Games (1983) ... another classic amongst the likes of 1995's "Hackers" (but actually predates Sneakers 1992)
It's a good'un!  One of the few semi-realistic hacking flicks.
Yeaaah...piss that money away lmfao
Thanks!!
Thanks!
Because he took a fast ball to the temple.  He used to crowd the plate. Pitchers hated it.   Made the strike zone disappear.

He had a pretty bad stutter
Oh yes, that is the best
Love denzel, I give him best actor though not voice.
Shit. Thulsa Doom. Not Thoth Amon
JEJ was a stutterer too.
And Thoth-Amon
I watched it and Hackers this week, they are both so good
Hackers is the best hacking movie, and I will not even entertain an argument against it.


Sneakers is probably number 2 though.  Great movie
With a burgundy interior.
Great flick! I also want a Winnebago
And one of the more accurate ones as far as methods. They actually used social engineering.
Sidney Poitier too. That movie was just loaded!
Fracking skin jobs
With Tony as the head of the prison. Gandolfini was such a great bad guy. From brutal mob boss to panzy mayor, to corrupt prison head. Dude had range.
I also liked Antitrust

Swordfish on the other hand is a pile of hot garbage
Feels so good
you and u/DjinnGSXR with the underated comments. thank you for the laffs.
Pow the lights went out. Now it’s just him and old Hercules.
Sand Lot
PERFECT RESPONSE
Bingo Long Traveling All Stars right?
I was hit by so many pitches, I can concur this is a good on base percentage strategy. I like the stock!
oh no
Yeah, that was another great role, but it's a little more obscure so I didn't mention it even though I thought about it too. Plenty of people know it, but it has more of a cult status.

Talking about obscurity, my earliest and fondest memories of James Earl Jones was in a PBS show "Long Ago and Far Away." He was the host and narrator.

The show was about fairy tales and old stories shown in animation (both traditional and stop motion puppetry). It's open up with him on screen like how Levar Burton was on Reading Rainbow.

So I knew him as this old gentle guy with a soothing voice who would tell me stories before I knew him as a Sith Lord or an evil sorcerer lol.
Cereal Killer was Matthew Lillard's magnum opus.
The scene in hackers where they are attacking the gibson feels like the bottom of the dip days when everyone jumps in buying gamestop trying to kill the shorts.
I almost spray painted my laptop after leaving g the theater...
I will never forgive Lorraine Bracco for her performance in that movie.  But, aside from that, I love it.  Saw it in the theaters twice.  Theater was empty both times.  It was great.
Is the Matrix a hacker movie?
*CRASH AND BURN*
tru. cant see angelina jolie's 24yr old tits in sneakers... just saying
Sneakers has better actors by far, therefore.... Not even an argument
Sorry, I can’t just let this sort of thing go:  
> “We have a zero bug!  
“Deploy antivirus!”  

All while punching a huge panel full of unlabeled buttons while watching a representation of a database getting corrupted that involves Pac-Man.
"Oh God, I'm driving."
"I never did telllll you why I left the CIA.



My temper."
Let’s not forget Ben Kingsley and River Phoenix.
I'd give SLC Punk! The slight edge
Apes Together Strong
Yes!!! She is totally phoning in in, almost ruins the movie for me
Awesome wasn't it.
“That wasn’t so hard. I should get my license again.”
Living in SLC makes me biased. SLC punk pretty much describes my life.
While I respect those movies I (for some reason) really have a soft spot on my heart for Mr. Lillard's performance in 13 Ghosts.
You should blow your nose, maybe swallow some of that spit for once.
