In shocking Harvard study , making your first stock purchase in GME over 250 has been shown to cause more mental damage than meth
I love WSB because I can find out about every big stock rally after they happen

40k Palantard's calls have gotta be printing hard today
PLTR - glad to be breaking even!
PLTR BOYS WE FEAST
Schwab is grossly negligent for approving my option trading application
Maybe I'll join PLTR gang *now*, instead of getting in early and bitching on reddit for a month straight
If PLTR can hit 30$ EOW and AAPL finally hits 140 EOW it will be great. 

Now who do I pray to for this to happen.

Calling it now. Palantir's double click demo day is literally just a video of Alex Karp and Peter Thiel double teaming Mark Zuckerberg's wife. They finish and both look into the camera: "Palantir is the software of the future now. Bitch".

PLTR TO THE FUCKING MOON
How many of us watching PLTR tomorrow like it's the super bowl?
Q: what’s the hardest part of holding PLTR?

A: telling your parents you’re gay.
My boss told me today he bought AAPL in 2007, sold in 2010, and never touched it again. 

It was really hard not to call him a fucking retard.
 Cathie bought a fucking Chinese food delivery service for ARKX

You know what? I love some of you guys.
Q: how do you know someone is a PALANTARD?
A: don’t worry, they’ll tell you
I know a lot of y'all weren't here around this time last year so let me break it down for you.   Protests?   Civil unrest?  Rising covid cases and a vaccine being halted?    This is all...

So idk about you, but I'm feeling pretty bullish right now
What are ya'll gonna do with your PLTR tendies?
Holding TSLA calls tonight...deep down I know it will go down tomorrow. But the 1% chance it moons. That 1% chance is worth it.
Veggie straws are better than they sound and look imho.
I might cry if I see PLTR up double digits tomorrow

WSB when ARKK@150:  Man if only I could get an good entry point.

WSB when ARKK@110 twice:  Cathie is finished.
Crazy how much your mood throughout the day depends on how green your positions are.
There’s nothing more 2021 than pretend money with a dog on it singlehandedly redeeming my portfolio’s entire losses from March

NIO, PLTR, ASO. My boys.
PLTR double click day
PLTR $25 unreal. I got so many upvotes on PLTR forever $24 last week.
You fingered her, but before you could fuck, she ran out of time and had to go home. You both said you'd get a chance to fuck next time. But she got a boyfriend and your paths never cross again. 

*Me with the calls I fingered but never clicked buy on*
PLTR 30 pleaseeeeee
Did my first option contract today, and let’s say just say I’m hornier than a pack wolf who just tried cocaine for the first time
Nothing in trading compares to the euphoria of hitting significant all time highs in your account and the feeling of taking your ideas of what “a lot of money” is to the next level.

The shitty part is when you inevitably fall off those highs because of the natural volatility in options trading, any form of recovery that you would have once been stoked about seems insignificant compared to the gains you once had and your new expectation of “a lot of money”
If you’re hating on PLTR rn, you must be a retarded ape that is bagholding Blockbuster-tier stocks. Just gtfo smoothbrain.
Red days hurt a lot worse when you suck at your job
I think my 3yo is the alpha now. He just called me a son of a bitch.

Tesla made more investing in a certain thing this year than they ever made selling electric cars. LOL Fucking Market is a joke
I made a good Buck off of sundial last week and decided to put it into a certain k9 currency. I am one happy shibe owner
Thinking about getting a job at Costco so I can invest more tendies, thoughts?
If PLTR is even close to 30 tomorrow sooo many people are gonna have a real tough decision on their calls.  Shit ton of money to be made.
Joined the 25k club today. Fuck the PDT rule
If you think this is the time to buy puts, remember some bears had the same idea last week. 

They are now all dead.
I’m a professional bagholder
Articles about how PLTR broke out of its bear pattern really making me nervous about my calls...
Next Tuesday will be the 1-year anniversary of when [WTI went negative](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/20/wti-crude-price-goes-negative-for-the-first-time-in-history). Fly your PPs at half-staff in remembrance of those who YOLO'd USO and for Tanker Gang.

I'm wondering if we're going to see a dip soon afterward with anybody who bought oil ETFs cashing out for long term gains.
PLTR APHA TSLA
Tlry and Apha yesterday was clearly a share shakeout. 18 the absolute lowest they can tank her. 

I think she hard bounces off the floor and rips to 35 now

Never thought my unrealized loss on PLTR would be under $100 after being down thousands 

Not sure what to do, might buy high again idk
Anyone just get that Webull notification?
Words cannot begin to describe the boundless gratefulness I am feeling right now. I was born to 2 first-gen immigrant parents. We resided below the poverty line during my early years and as soon as they climbed out the recession hit and their house was foreclosed on. And now I YOLO’d my last $1000 into $SPY FDs. I lost most of it today without flinching, financial security unwavering. It has been an unbelievable privilege blowing up my account with you all for the fourth time. I will see you all again soon.

With eternal gratitude,

GUH

Well damn, looks like I need to replace my phone.  The screen is messed up, showing PLTR in green instead of the normal red.
Hello darkness, my old friend

So now all I have is...

We feast on some AAPL tomorrow.
dont tease me PLTR
Been at 200 shares in PLTR at $24 avg for awhile now. Nice to see green days but I will not sell this shit for another 5 years.
Even though I *know* COIN will be overvalued at the bell, and even though I *know* that most growth happens in the private market now. I’ll still probably fomo in, attempt to day trade, and end up losing
I initially created a Reddit to look at casual porn. Fast forward to now. I log on to Reddit to look at loss porn.

Alright boys I did some research. 

14 days is the most the SPY has ever been green in a row 

1971 was when that happened. It was Also the only time it went more than 12 days green. 

We are either on the 2nd best streak or greatest streak of all time
All this bleeding in Tesla for weeks all worked out today. Nothing feels better seeing options come back to life and selling and locking in profits. Good job TSLA gang
Dumping 5K into COIN tomorrow. Will double down once the hype fades and if it retains it's DPO support levels.
The higher we go, the more obvious a correction feels. 

But if it’s obvious, it won’t happen. 

So we will continue to go higher and higher and higher forever because it will keep becoming more obvious which means it won’t happen
Pltr to the moon
Watching small cap tech die has felt like a 2 month prostate exam
AAPL about to tear bears asshole off the rest of this week

I got leaps and 225 shs, but very strange dude.

Anybody holding Tesla calls overnight?
On PLTR: I know the past doesn’t guarantee the future, but on the last demo day it was green demo day and the day after. With the current hype, I see no reason it shouldn’t go up at least a little more, even if it’s nothing like the massive spike from last time. Too many people think it’s over and it’s not even demo day...
Imagine using 'imagine' as a rhetorical device

TSLA breaks $800 PM tomorrow?
I bought my first GME shares this afternoon to finally put the nail in the coffin and kill the damn thing already so we can stay normal again in the market.
I bought like 3 TSLA 750 calls this morning, because that's all I can afford with my life's worth. Went back to work flipping burgers all day. My account went from 1500 to 6000. I was really sad the last few weeks but I'm actually feeling content now.
If pltr hits 40 tomorrow I will finally take my dog out of the microwave
I already have heavy PLTR bags. I hope this stock moves further up tomorrow so at least my loses are covered.

TITLE: WSB loves Gain / Loss / YOLO posts. Rule Review.TEXT: WSB is all about making high risk, high reward plays. We organize these with the [Gain](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AGain), [Loss](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ALoss), and [YOLO](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AYOLO) flairs.

With so many new faces, it's important that we highlight what it means to make a good thread with these flairs.

# Gain / Loss Minimums

**Options Threshold:** $2,500 USD

**Shares Threshold:** $10,000 USD

---

# YOLO Minimums

**Options Threshold:** $10,000 USD

**Shares Threshold:** $25,000 USD

# Posting Guidelines:

The first image should include all the information about your trade, such as:

* Stock name

* Number of shares / contracts

* Total invested amount

* Profit / Loss

* Strike(s) and/or Expiry Date (if applicable)

Other images are optional. People love seeing all time graphs, so include that where possible. 

When your positions exceed a single screenshot, place the largest one first.

**Leave a comment with why you entered the trades that you did.** This is usually more interesting than the gain / loss porn itself. You took the risk and put your money where your mouth is, tell us why.

---

##*Important!* 

* Your gain or loss *must* be realized, or about to expire (<1 day) before you can post. If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close. (**YOLO threads are exempt from this**)

* Be timely with your posts, if you have a big gain, loss, or YOLO, post it right away. No one wants to see a bet you made months ago.

* The minimum applies to any amount you hold **in a single company**, so three $1K losses on TSLA puts at different strikes/expiries is allowed, but a $1K loss on TSLA, PLTR, and AAPL puts is not. That's called diversification, and diversification is for pussies.

We're not suggesting you close your current positions, but we want to make sure that the threads that are being posted are interesting and meaningful. As they say, it's not a loss until you sell... right?!

>We're not suggesting you close your current positions

Guys close your positions. Money is ??? but reddit karma is sweet sweet lifeblood.
I love you for this it's definitely going to clear all that clutter of paper losses that's not expiring for a while, and post that aren't even remotely a YOLO play. I mostly just hid the post but nice to see some change.
Thank u god. Hope this clears up the cancer of trash posts we’ve seen the last few months. Nobody cares about these broke boys with their 5 shares of GME or AMC.
I think everyone’s first gain/loss/yolo *needs* to be options. Shares are boring. I wanna see some ten or twenty baggers people.
YES STOP POSTING SHIT POORS !!!
U MAKE ME
SICK !!
TLDR: Don't post loss porn if you're poor. Also have you tried not being poor?
What about updates on yolo's - I get that dfv rightly can swing his dick but now you have dweebs posting about their gradual accumulation of amc or some other dwarf account. Get that shit outta here, I don't give a fuck about your retirement fund.

"i WiLl bUy gAMesToP"..... 





Cunts
I wish *share* YOLOs weren't even allowed. I don't understand the point of them. It's not risky and millions of people do it every day. No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. We don't need posts of people just buying shares. They're most likely the same shares everyone else has lol. Remove them and only allow share loss/gain posts. Those are the only things people care about. Only allowing share loss/gain posts knocks 2 birds out with 1 stone. It shows the YOLO and the loss/gain.
But my BB shares are up $10 today
There should be a percentage of account requirement or something. Someone with a $1m account throwing $25K in shares of something isn't a YOLO; someone with a 5K margin account throwing 9K in OTM options expiring the next day is a YOLO
Would be nice to ban shares from these completely but this is a wonderful step in the right direction
One minor gripe I have is the billion dollar market cap rule. There's companies that sit around that cap or under it and break the rule but are legit YOLO plays. I mean hell if risk is the spice of this kitchen a sub billion market cap is higher risk than a mega cap or w/e.

Not advocating pennystocks or anything like that and don't think DD should necessarily be allowed on cap<1B but the spirit of a YOLO is maximum retard at its most spectacular.
Please enforce these rules. Ready for WSB to get back to normal pre GME era
#Yeeesssssss
I think the mods should consider decreasing minimum for YOLO if it’s expiring on same week. 

Not sure how feasible that is to enforce just a suggestion. I have seen a lot 400-1000 weeklies turn to 30k+ on here.
The rules we need, but not the ones we deserve. 

It's almost like OIP knows what he's doing!
Been here since the first GME squeeze in Jan and I’ve loved every minute, here to stay and I cannot wait to lose more money with you all!
I just posted a yolo, but the mod wouldn’t accept just the ArkX options.  So I had to post a screenshot of other holdings so it would accept.  It wasn’t ideal
#*jack nicholson head nodding gif*
>Your gain or loss **must** be realized, or about to expire (<1 day) before you can post. If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close.

I like this idea! but I feel like no one follows this rule, and will continue to not, lol. Especially because once you close your position, it’s usually less obvious from a given screenshot what the return was from that specific security.
I’m glad we are revisiting this, solid improvements needed for our sub now
Yessss losing over 10k means I make the threshold wooohooo
we love to see NIO yolos!
 That's called diversification, and diversification is for pussies. 

So I take more loan yes
Dude check out my .0007 stock in GME! I'm to the moon baby!
“Diversifying”
Why do you guys use such big words all the time?
Why is there such a low options gain minimum? Like if I make a 10K yolo and gain 2.5K that’s pussy shit IMO
Gain minimums might need to be updated to 500k when/if GME moons
New phone, who dis?
GME without AMC support makes both of us less strong. Let's change that within subs, soldiers
Well if someone kills it this is saying you can’t post if you ever hold term? Some people like to take cost basis it and let it ride?  Otherwise sounds good. My 2 cents
wait so its too late to post my 10k loss from SPY weekly straddles in December? (also what has been up with trades from months ago showing up now)
Can we still allow loss posts that are more drawn-out account blowups? I still want to be able to see the aftermath of someone grinding down a 100k+ account to dust over losses from multiple trades. Maybe minimum absolute loss 6-figures and relative loss >50% of the all-time with text telling the story/biggest trades?
Tell that to my ex wife
That is actually what Buffet and Munger say basically
Diversifi-who-what?
So we shouldn't diversify our losses?
yes, sound advice for r/investing. not for r/wallstreetbets...peep the last word (ill give you a hint: BETS)
cobra kai!
Diversifiedfuckingvalue doesn't sound right
Yup, been seeing a lot of "loss porn" on LEAPS. Unless if they're planning on selling them at -75% 8 months out from expiration then I guess they belong here.
I'm tired of seeing the gme options posts from February and January. I know gme kinda sucks right now for gain porn but that's just karma farming
I have 5 of each!
I want to see more options at 0.01
Nah shares can be good but I think the thresholds should be significantly higher. Like $100k+ gain/loss for shares and maybe $500k/$1mm for a share YOLO
Ease off the cocaine, brosef
I mean it's just like attractiveness and regular porn right? I get asked "Have you tried being not ugly?" At least once a week. And that's just from my wife.
> "i WiLl bUy gAMesToP".....

The "I will own Gamestop" guy is pretty legit though
I don't really like share YOLOs either, especially for larger stocks, however, there have been some interesting share YOLOs on stocks that don't usually get discussed, like PRPL or PINS. Another example of where they would make sense is in biotech companies with binary events.

One solution could be to raise the limit to $50K or $100K (and as the sub grows, this becomes more feasible) -- but we've already just raised it from $10K to $25K, so it may be better to take it slow for now.

That said, if the position is big enough, then no matter which way the stock moves, a sufficiently large share YOLO would qualify for the gain/loss flair.
I don't mind them personally, I'm skilled enough to lose *a lot* of money with just shares in a very short period of time. It is kind of boring when they buy something with no volatility though.
Shares of 3X leveraged ETFs should be allowed. I wanna see those.
> No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. 

And posts like that would be rightfully downvoted. Still though it's fun to see people yeet tens of thousands at a stock I never heard of, or a company that's super volatile during earnings, or at risk of going bankrupt.
We were also all bitching in August when everything was a TSLA YOLO and those were options. 

As much as I hate seeing the same shit now we do go through that, and if the rules are *too* limiting we might have a feed that gets really boring.


^(I’ll never bitch about TSLA again)
Share YOLO’s shouldn’t be allowed at all.
I mean personally haven't yolo'd. For shares I'd ban shares on blue chip companies. For contracts idc
share yolos on penny or meme stonks can be very interesting! but those were someone bought a million in nio back in november 2020 for example
Lol as if 25k in aapl can be even considered a yolo. Thats about as safe of investment someone can make except spy. Put another way i wouldnt even blink or lose any sleep over that much in aapl (in fact i bought twice that much in the last few weeks and thats just one of my holdings, and im one of the most risk averse people youll ever meet). 

A true yolo should be you and your children will literally be on the streets if the trade goes south.
The solution to that would be to just not have share YOLO posts. Only allow the gain/loss post. Literally the solution to all the issues with share posts is to only allow gain/loss posts.
It's a slippery slope to P&D posts
Probably would be really hard to keep track and then looking back over time. At this point someone at least could make it an impressive gain
That was the beginning of the end of this sub lol
lol you’re fucked bro
She understands how diversifying the men she sleeps with is important though
Hahaha
Between your dick, her boyfriend's dick, and mine, her pussy was certainty for diversification
Di-worse-ification
True! Though “diversification is for pussies” sounds much better than Munger’s “diworseification”
He mean divorce with your money
Diversifier? I hardly knew her.
I do. As soon as I start to lose I jump to something else and lose there too
Half of this sub is sick of GME at this point
Puts are printing, still gain porn material.
I think he and DFV are the only two who should get to swing their dicks around.
I'm biased because based on their last update I'm holding more shares than them, but I only care to see yolo updates in the format of adding a buy-in that meets the current rule requirements, unrealized gains that are double or more, or unrealized losses that are half or more.
Share yolos should be your entire account or net worth or at least a very significant and impactful portion
Share and option YOLOs should be text posts with the YOLO screenshot. The text should contain the reasoning behind. This would be more powerful than some questionable DDs. 

Also, aren't we here exchanging ideas for future gain? Gain/loss porn look at the past. YOLOs look at the future.
With share YOLOs the gain/loss is going to be minimal. Most shares fluctuate like 1-5% each day. So even at $100k the loss is going to be minimal and boring and not even worthy of a loss/gain post. So what's the point of allowing the YOLO post if the loss/gain is going to be minimal? If it was me, I'd set the minimum at 250k since a daily drop/gain could actually be a lot.
what if maybe the circumstances behind the yolo justify it? for example, lets say someone pulled a personal loan for 25k, and Yolos on some stock on full margin. ya shares are lame, but I think the double trouble money borrowing would make it just retarded enough to fit the nature of this sub. not like I'm doing this right now obviously so don't ask me about it.  baka.
ban blue chip shares ?
>  I wanna see those.

Yeah, the gain/loss posts. Just posting that you bought it isn't that intersting.
SOXL anyone???
> And posts like that would be rightfully downvoted.

And so should posts about AMC or whatever flavor of the week it is. No one really cares unless you gain or lose. What is the take-away from someone posting they bought 25k of AMC? What is there to discuss? Nothing. You're 1 of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who are doing the same thing. It's not special.
But if there's a massive threshold like 10k on it I can't see the problem. Tis but a dream
And DFV
That's why I told these mods two months ago to only restrict posting to those who subbed to WSB before the GME craze. But let everyone else comment. That would have cleared up the quality of posts without shutting down gme. But of course the mods didn't take heed, I mean what else do you expect from a bunch of cucks lmao
Sub is unusable since GME started its run, it was fun for a while but man, it’s boring seeing the same shit memes copy pasted over and over.

Still waiting for it to hit $100k a share though, which I’m told was a guarantee basically.
Today one of those days where both calls and puts were both red across the board, almost all were double-digit too lol
I wanna helicopter it up too
It's hard to communicate "you can post YOLOs but only above a certain investment amount but below a certain market cap", I wouldn't blame anyone for being confused. 

And what would you allow from large market caps? Would you include AMD? ($100B) How about TSLA? ($750B)
Agree. That’s what I mean.
> What is the take-away from someone posting they bought 25k of AMC?

The fact that its hugely volatile?

I'm tired of the meme stocks too and most of the people they brought with them. Nature will heal. Doesn't mean we need to ban share posts outright.
Ouch
Gay mods r gay :/
Hey u/memetron9000 you gonna let this guy talk about you like this?
There's still some funny shit. The paper trading competition thread was keeping me entertained for hours
Nah you can still dig up some good DD if you look hard
If you were quick you could have made quite a bit with it fluctuating to that 132 low. Not a lot of liquidity though at the moment, very low volume.
I see your point. Ye nvm
> The fact that its hugely volatile?

Which is what the gain/loss posts are for. See what I mean? No one really cares about your volatile stock until something happens.
Guh
TITLE: GME - It's all coming togetherTEXT: Apes, I come to you as a fellow primate with excellent news: my wife finally left me. Now I have her boyfriend all to myself.

Before I reading, I just want to express that predictions and dates should not be taken as absolute and that these are just my opinions on what COULD be coming. I am also well aware that correlation does not equal causation and that these correlations could be coincidences, so please don't comment that, these are just my thoughts based on research that I've done. I've done many posts on GME and these are all my personal opinions based on my research, so do not take them as fact. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

There's been an onslaught of news regarding GME in the past few weeks and days, and I believe that there is more to come and that because of that the squeeze is inevitable and in the near future.

**The news:**

\- Amazon + Chewey Execs being appointed

\- RC being named god of the board

\- GME announcing the search for new C.E.O.

\- GME paying off senior notes (today)

\- The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3.5M shares or $1B in value (this may not seem important but I'll explain why it's crucial later)

\- The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting (6/9 lmao)

**Why it matters:**

The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME, and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation. I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional. The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares. When GME made this announcement, the stock was at $190. GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens, the market would react negatively to the stock, and, because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting, that negative reaction could've been huge. Despite knowing this, they decided not to sell at that moment. I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190, they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so. With that being said, I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190. If this wasn't their plan, then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock, which it did. Finally, when almost every analyst (boomers) says that GME is grossly overvalued, it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless.... you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher. Therefore, I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock.

To add to this, GME has repeatedly warned in their S.E.C. filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze (they have said this twice since the original squeeze). This, to me, seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze. What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought (again just a theory).

**Catalyst**

But what could the next announcement be? It's very difficult to actually know. The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere. I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C.E.O. position or the digital transformation. GME could very well announce Cohen as the C.E.O., which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere. They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e-commerce. Again, this is simply conjecture, but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price. However, the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall. First, I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares, only individual investors can do that. If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears... oh wait. If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall, that could be the ultimate catalyst for us. Or, if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote, an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares (see my previous DD on that).

Personally, I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon, but I guess not. Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep. 

**Timing**

The timing on the possible above-mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect. First, our lord and savior Mr. Gill's calls expire this Friday. At the same time, GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume (pictured below). The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways. As many of you know, the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are. What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think "wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap... time for some chaos." Finally, we have the 4/20 (lmao) deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting. I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because, as I said previously, they have a vested interest in getting this above $190.

Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles (yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c58px0bui0t61.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=6cf2c498feccf05e468d3dc2c0d7fb570923a02b

Finally, I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX. Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY, which seems to be true, but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX. This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad, but GME moves when the market is volatile (which usually happens when the market is bad). And, oh would you look at that, SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 (pre-pandemic levels). Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility. For more on this, I encourage you to read "the everything short" post, which provides a much more in-depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that.

Here are the charts. The first one is VIX and the second is SPY (both are the purple lines), as you can see, the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME. This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions. As stated previously, the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility, so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change. The thing to get from this is that, based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX, this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low:

**Quick Note on Short interest**  

Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest. As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest. Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19%-50% which is still extremely high. Most apes say that it's over 100% at minimum. I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting, naked shorting, and synthetic longs (see other posts for more on this). Therefore, I believe that the true short interest is over 100%. It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2% with short interest being able 20% and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today. Also, based purely on logic, it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it, so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50%. Therefore, I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious. 

**Conclusion**

So, we have technicals lining up very nicely, a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now, a plethora of potential catalysts, a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled, abusive shorting, a failure to deliver cycle, an insanely volatile stock that loves good news, a market that is thirsty for some volatility, and oh year one more thing.... some damn primates that refuse to sell. Stay strong, apes.finally I saw a triangle today! This is a relief !
Literally gave away a silver to a guy in the daily gme thread but should’ve given to you. May have to recall it but I’m sure it’s been lent out to 25 other users now and shorted to shit
Needed to see this, STAY STRONG EVERYONE..

SHORTS HAVE TO COVER, ITS COMING..
Crazy that everything that seems to be a great direction for literally any other company, the price would sky rocket. 

Painting a clear picture of the possible turn around and it tanks. And nobody’s downgrade their bullshit price targets? Haha haha. I’m laughing all the way to the bank
Great read, really appreciate it dude
My naughty parts are tingling
So buy more? Got it
Welp. Wether it happens tomorrow or this time next year I'm holding untill then. 
Everything else is just speculation and distraction. 
I just set price alerts, go about my day at my shitty back breaking job, and make sure my bills are payed. 
If I have some other Xtra "scratch" I buy some more. 
This is inevitable. But it could take some time. 
Everyone needs to realize that alot of big players don't want the little players to win. 
Hold/buy more when it dips and you will be rich. 
Don't put a fucking timeline on it man..
All the ol big nuts and shriveled dick curve.
the more I think about it, this isn't just class warfare but also generational to some extent as well. Millennials vs Boomers (and some other generations mixed around too)
Nice DD..... made my little PP bounce
Fly me to the moon  
Let me play up there with those stars  
Let me see what life is like  
On a-Jupiter and Mars  
In other words, hold my hand  
In other words, darling, kiss me
BOOM
A double triangle! Its almost a triple triangle!!!
I just read this wall of DD and turned into Hammy (from Over the Hedge) and yelled, "Let's call it Steve."  :-)   And then my thankful self turned into Ozzie and said, "Oh, great and powerful Steve!"  :-)
Let's get that dividend boyyyyssss. Make the hedgies pay us
Several sentiment catalysts of value, but two things specifically.  Having been a Sr Exec in TWO public companies, of course the Chairman, CEO, and board members know for a fact more info on SI than is public.  I also no longer believe in coincidences. 

You apes may call me a boomer, at the end of that generation, but I like the stock and I like the happenings, having been there.

Catalysts indeed.  350 strong at an average of approx $63 in my second buy after I sold at $101 in March on the way down, bought in again at $42.44 and averaged up to that magical $63. Following closely after reading some DD here and doing some of my own.  I wanted to buy again at $136 this morning. And should have but didn't for whatever assanine reason. CHWY has also been good to me, in early because my wife buys there all the time for our two pups (that said we also buy local from our long time vet).  Local is also good. Especially now with all the bullshit we have been dealing with for far too long.

I'm gonna just hold and watch.  Good luck to all of us.
I like your DD, I would like to add a possible big news announcement could also be a return of dividends.

Can we be sure that GameStop hasn't sold any of its 3.5 million shares though? I'm not sure when we would find out if they did choose to sell them.

I see a lot of hate for IBD around here and I'm not sure why. If an ape smarter than me could explain why it's good/bad source I would definitely like to know.
There’s one thing wrong with your post, there hasn’t been a single squeeze yet. The run up to 450s was due to supply and demand.
Read title in Kronk's voice
Jesus you guys are an army
OP you're confusing me... you said "  I personally believe that websites are correct " regarding short interest
TL;DR: stock most likely going up, but it could go sideways or down first. Hold til Valhalla.
Thank you uncle Hanky for the confirmation bias
My mom is coming to get me
Share. Recall. That’s the mother of all catalysts. We need it. Now.
u/HomeDepotHank69

Not only do they have a vested interest in getting it over 190, but over 285! Maximum of 3.5M shares at a maximum of 1B dollars. Every cent over 285.71 is fewer shares they have to sell.
I’m not a financial advisor but if I was I would say wait for the squeeze and don’t sell until it starts going down. Wish I could read OP - Sent From My iPhone
Holding. Buying the dip. Got it Champ.
This is a good summary. Thanks!
Great recap! Thank you!
Im pretty sure a company can’t outright sell 3.5million shares without announcing it beforehand.

Just like that rule when you own like 5% of a company if u intend to sell your position you have to notify that you will. 

But the fact they didn’t might be beneficial.
GME ready to go full Phineas for real this time
10 mil per share or bust
When this all comes together, we'll all be $CUMming together
Could one bet on vix to crash as gme rises?

PROFF OR FUCKING BAN
It looks like a ladle not a cup are ladles a thing in the chart world?
Fuck yeah look at that triangle
I don’t think it’s a cup and handle pattern but u are right it’s definitely a wedge
Forgot about being paid in shares
Sorry if this has been answered before but who has the authority to margin call citidal? . Who lent them their money ?
Good news I almost pissed on my balls.
Cup and handle, or swimming pool with hottub in this case.
Something about tits
Ape buy
Holy Madonna tits that is a triangle!
Did I just find an actually good GME DD? no way

Edit: obligatory crayon drawing comment
You had me at correlation does Not prove causation.  There might be a wrinkle in that brain of yours.  Nice  report.
[insert Charlie Kelly in mailroom meme]
Just the confirmation bias I was looking for.
This is the bias I come for.  Came twice from your first 2 sentences.
Spice cakes!!!
Bullish still.


YEAH BABY THIS IS THE WAY
what is this "sell" I keep seeing in the o.p?
Bought more today right before the news.  Averaging down from 300 has been rough but should be at a gain after this week with all this news!  Can’t wait for the new CEO announcement!
This ape needs his confirmation bias-nanas
This is why I'm losing my mind. 

*runs around knocking on doors* 

"The Tendies are coming! The Tendies are coming!"
This is a lot of words
DFV becomes a GME activist investor that recommends via social media and written letter that all shareholders recall their shares, let’s goooo
They sold stock already look their outstanding stock last week it was 67.95 now it’s 70.03 from that money they paid off debts
I can’t wait to dress like Yung Gravy
Is it weird that i nutted reading this ?
I just got so excited I threw my poo against the wall.
I love Hank
Don’t worry bois, I bought 2 shares today. The whale has breached.
AMC banana ape man here. You gme apes good apes. Find big dipper banana plan. Good news for gme ape. AMC ape no care about news. We ape only know three things: but banana, hold banana, and napping in sun on banana pile.
This feeds my confirmation bias which i barely understand so i will just say me keep hold bc post make me feel good
Bought five more today... up to a whopping eleven shares.  Its honest ~~work~~ gambing.
People spreading FUD about to look pretty darn silly once the squeeze has squoze
GenXr in with three house payments and a Sonic Youth signed limited double album in GME. Selling my last OG Beanie Babies on eBay to buy the God Damn Dip. Don't You...Forget About Me.
You should call your mom.
You’re using what looks to be Microsoft Paint... on a linear chart....

Switch to Log chart. Use a site or program that has built in tools for TA.

Every single upwards support line you can draw has been invalidated, or it’s far far below where price is now. Price has also fallen below 20 & 50 day MAs. There is 0 bullish case to be made here. 

TA wise, the only thing that stands out on this chart is an Adam and Eve double top. With a dead cat bounce already sprinkled in.  

Watch out below, careful when catching them knives - https://www.tradingview.com/x/YEptUCH7/
can we get a SHEEESH train?!!!
The reason the borrowing rate percengage doesn’t make sense is because you don’t want it to make sense. The data in front of your eyes is correct and you choose not to believe it and make these elaborate excuses to justify it. The shorts have covered, that’s it.
^What he said^
So, will the primary residence be in Waikiki or on the north shore?  Definitely getting one of those new electric hummers tho.  Banana colored.
OMG, the new CEO is going to be Bezos!! That's why he retired from Amazon, because he knows GME has even more potential!
So if flags are just flags on trend, as in its a bull flag on an upward trend, and a bear flag on a downward trend And the 400$ prices are  behind us, and the second spike was a lower price. Doesn't that mean your crayons are telling you this will break out but a downward break out? 

If anyone believes the magic crayon lines there has to be someone warning the people of potential bad times.
Lol. Y'all thinking MOAS is actually a thing with GME is adorable.
I'm wondering if those 3.5 million shares are close to the short? Could gme sell those to allow shorts to cover which wouldn't leave much for us if we can't find a buyer? Seems like it would track the stock and support of they did that....
This is an honest, and serious question. In your first paragraph, you mention the stock offering. What if they did offer, and no one took them up on it. If all the analysts say the stock is only worth 12-25 a share, why in the world would anyone buy it at 190?
Keep dreaming LMFAO 

Congrats on holding a stock that's never going to spike like you all want
Imagine thinking GME is still going to the moon despite the fact that's been steadily declining for a month now.
Confirmation Bias just delivers that dopamine oh so good, time to buy more tomorrow
I've been wondering since January when GME first squeezed up if Gamestop or any publicly traded company is able to hire a private investigator or maybe hire a hedge firm to get access to information about what shorters are really doing to their stock price. I know that GME has insider information about the company but do they have more accurate information about how really bad the shorting is.
Bias confirmed. Hold. Gotcha
Is the thought that GME didn't sell the 3.5MM shares when they could, or that they're going to use those shares to pay the new Board members those shares in the 100% equity they're receiving?
IS WALLSTREET BEATS JUST ABOUT GME?
Obviously sooner is better but I hope it happens after I get paid on Friday otherwise I'm overdrawing my bank account to buy on Thursday
I'm sorry, can someone tldr, does this mean buy or don't rn
.
Thank god for triangles!
I'm using GME to hedge against these losses I'm taking in the EV sector.

Not selling a single fucking share. My thesis is still in tact I'm holding.
I miss the DD where it was an Ape. We’re stronk togetherness
Dunno what all this means, but

I just want to make more money to throw at apes with boobies.
Hmmm, speeding ticket,or GME? I'm legit torn lol
So my thoughts is that the hedge funds know that this Friday could be the catalyst. As such they will short everything they can including perhaps a 28 million dollar apartment they just sold. All I am saying is get ready for some easy dip buys on Friday.
So do I have time to move the other half of my GME to my TFSA or what
So... you’re saying I should buy puts on VIX?  The market always moves against my trades, so a put should trigger MOASS.
so buy GME and VIX?
You've just peaked an interest from my husband's girlfriend...
You deduce huh?
Nice DD. This is the way!
Was a proxy statement released saying that the 20th was the deadline to recall shares and register to vote in the upcoming shareholders meeting? 

I subscribe to GME emails and haven't seen this yet...
Man i cant read well but i read "this is financial advice please take it serious and plan accordingly ".
Guess ill hold
link to 'everything short' post pls?
Lines and colors pretty. Makes me want to buy more GME.
Hmmm, needs more triangles
wow you can connect those 3 points into a triangle?  what are the chances of that??!!??
What's the estimated quantity threshold to declare intention to recall shares and be successful?

If multiple individuals independently decide to exercise this course,  does it solidify the recall more than one individual? 

Asking for some Cetaceans.... uh friends.

u/JuxtaposeLife do you know the details on this?

Been waiting weeks for a triangle like that. Goddamn I can break out the 96 pack crayons in peace again
I haven’t had a boner since March, and you just brought it back. I’ll leave you all the shares I’m gonna buy tomorrow in my will
The Cohen CEO news will not propel the stock, he’s currently that persons fucking boss and it didn’t do dick. Why would the CEO title matter more than the person the CEO answers to?? I know I’m dumb but that makes zero fucking sense. Believe me I’m holding and will continue to, but that line of thought is dumb by even my standards. Only thing launching this are those DTCC laws and the new SEC leader and margin calling
I like the DD!
Hey I've seen this post before
Always look forward to your crazy DD’s Hank. My 4/16 calls would love a squeeze this week but I’m sure I’ll have to wait haha.
Im just holding.
A wiggly lined triangle is what GME needed this whole time
I love seeing posts that summarize all the awesome announcements that have been coming out of GME! Confirmation bias confirmed!
Chaos is a ladder.
Yay ... we all Coming together. Group hug in the shower!
Yes. I love triangles!
So....all those words and I just got: hold....

me. smart. ape.
I see triangles
Here's whats gonna happen on 6/9

"Breaking news! Ryan Cohen is now gamestop's ceo, and gamestop just bought amazon! The stock just hit 1 trillion!"
MELVIN: KNEES

IN MY HAND: KEYS(LAMBO)

GME: SQUEEZE

PAPERHAND: &%$#@ PLEASE!!!
I see a lot of beautiful charts! This must be true!
I rate this DD a 36DD out of 10
Holy moly! I'm very surprised there's still a ton of love for GME on WSB. For the past few weeks, as soon as I mention GME and/or apes, I would get downvoted, yelled at, called out like hell. 

To the moon we go GME!!!
Pro tip: Save taxes by investing your 401k in GME!
All we need to know is the 4/20 and 6/9 dates. That is communicating that they understand the power of MEMES. Cohen reads these reddit threads too. Share recall = catalyst, hedgefunds destroyed.
New market indicator for big upward mooning, soup ladle
But but but but MUH ANALYSTS... they say red red no thinky big for yourself. 

In other words ape to analyst..... ape buy more?
Still, thats one big flag for ape to climb with banana
Cool, so possibly another month of manipulation then?
I went all GME in this marketwatch game for school so I hope it goes up so I can claim whatever my teacher said the prize was when the game ends
Holy shit this is actually good DD.
Have you ever considered the timing of the short attacks and why HF choose to short at this time?
So sell now so we can buy high later? Got it
woof
What flavor of crayons is your favorite.
Fuck it. I’m buying more tomorrow. To the fucking moon!!!
I see people saying they won't sell for less than x. But I can't even set a sell for 1500/share. How do I make sure I dont miss the moonshot? I'm on etrade.
I am still holding out for the $130,000 price.  So fuck you all
$Ltnc is the better bet trust me
I disagree with the reasoning of your first point why they didnt sell at $190 because it is in the company's best interest to maximize their shareholder's value so they would never dump bags at elevated prices to retail investors if they believe it would dump lower. Selling to shorts during squeeze is another story, I don't see any reason for them not to
And the biggest catalyst of them all...Apes Together Strong shirts arriving. I've got this bad boy on right now, and it feels so damn good.
Great read!

Apes together smart
Your DD  ignite  my appetite for fucking,  buying and holding ..... SIR
u/crackboi96 I don’t even know anymore but we are in a red portfolio anyways so FUCK IT SCOOP A FEW
This guys super smart for a retard! Impressed!
That's no cup and handle, it's a fucking skillet... Stocks gonna be hot!
If the stock borrow is 2% and the company is willing to offer $1bn of shares and everyone understands the volatility of the stock why would there be a squeeze? Every ape has already called their brokers to make sure they are not lending their shares.
Reading Stuff like this makes me want to like Yolo all my money mortgage 2nd mortgage my house and put it all into GME but 1 We all know that's not a good idea and you can only and should only invest what you are willing to lose...
Perfectly said! Thank you. Love the 4/20 & 6/9 dates, haha. So juicy.
So explain this for me... slowly cause I'm smooth brained.

In the first chart the VIX is in line with GME during its first squeeze in January, and in the second SPY is inverse. Now wouldn't we want to see the same thing happening coming up to this potential MOASS? Wouldn't we like to see the VIX climbing and SPY tanking rather than the inverse?

Been holding since December but still don't understand shit.
This is the quality content the sub needs more of, not crappy posts.  OP i hope you become a millionaire.
Conclusion:  Buy GME with both hands.
Paid off senior notes this early? That’s a huge fuck you to the hegies.
I love how a post with 150+ awards only has 6k likes. It's as if there were were some effort keeping this from the front page or something
What the fuck do they think is going to happen when they pinch the price down too low? that will be the catalyst...
I’ve only just read your first long paragraph so far, and I had to comment that I love what you deduced. It makes psychological sense to me.
Confirmation bias confirms my bias.
These threads are steadily descending into Iraqi dinar revaluation territory. You guys better get out while you can salvage something out of it.
Wait, so shares have to be recalled by 4/20 for a meeting on 6/9? Cohen's trying to tell us he's watching out for us lol.
I’m not reading this shit but I like the stock
You convinced me, [$190 prediction it is.](https://www.factionfinancial.com/prediction/30ff9eab-4477-47c7-8457-2aee19e86609)

420 Blaze it boys!
$1B/3.5Ms=$285.71

I see that as the minimum price target before they start releasing shares little by little.
I've been hearing for 2 months now that it's all coming together. I hope it does soon.
i rEAd oNce, It waz FUb n
Kind of a triangle IN a triangle!  A Duoriangle?
You have doubts?
I learned in grade school that triangle is the strongest shape. ape hold
Yep, triangle on the thumbnail = instant upvote
Recall it, it is now worth 1000 Silvers!
Tomorrow on Motley Fool: forget GME, Reddit is shorting $SLV
sorry, you can only recall time from a Bulgarian boy
I know a guy you can call who knows a guy who knows where to locate more .
The silver squeeze will squoze!
me too
the questions thats bugging me, how many banks are in on this???
Yeah I wonder where they will find the shares to cover?  It's not like the company will just make brand new shares to sell to them!

Oh, wait...
ItS alReADy PrICeD In!!!
The company doesn't need the share price to rise at any particular time. They've got enough cash rolling in from the current console cycle to sit on the share offering for as long as it takes. They're simply bullish on the transition to the future GME and know that the shares will be above $280 eventually, whether it's next week or next year doesn't matter.

The short interest discussion is completely absurd. Your assumption that boomers have to be shorting because they're boomers is dumb. Boomers may be bearish but they're also scared shitless when they see others getting castrated on their shorts. And the manipulation has been proceeding unabated for this long, what will stop it from continuing? I see no reason to believe short interest has come down, nor to dismiss 20% short as not that high.
Proud I was able to get through all of it without dosing off
Good tingles and not the thailand tingles, I hope.
Stop staring through my window please.
confirmation biased confirmed  cause my balls and dick looks like this
Gen-X is heavily invested in this. We grew up on GameStop. EB Games, Babbages, and Funcoland. We have the most disposable income right now and might finally make a difference in the world.
This is world wide brotha!
My boomer family members are evil. That’s all.
hey hey now. no need to fling feces at your elders, baby ape. there are plenty of boomer apes here supporting the shrewdness (look it up). and plenty of Xers and Millennials sitting on the sidelines.
Millennial here and my boomer dad has been listening to me and every week no matter the price he come up to me to say that he is buying ten more shares. I dont even know how many the old man has now
Worst generation ever
Very little of war is fought on a literal battle field with bullets or bayonets.
It made my PP go da doing doing doing
I always hear James Darren in Star Trek DS9.
Triple triangle, now that's just absurd!
What does it mean???
IBD is only one source of many many places people/institutions can borrow shares. If they run out it means nothing at all because they can get them elsewhere.

At best it’s a gauge to see how many are gone from that one place, but doesn’t tell us much more than that
Somewhere (in WSB) I read that when a company pays dividends that the shorts have to pay them.... is that true?? And why haven’t the shirts been paying the gme dividend?? Very dumb. Please excuse.
> Can we be sure that GameStop hasn't sold any of its 3.5 million shares though? I'm not sure when we would find out if they did choose to sell them.

The reservation is for *up to* $1B raised using *up to* 3.5M shares, which would require a stock price of $285 if they wanted to reach the former goal within the constraints of the latter. I can't say with certainty that the board wouldn't be happy with a lesser amount (like $500M) but if they're looking to maximize their take wouldn't they wait?
I doubled my stake today. I have two shares now.
How does this have so many upvotes lol.   I am long $GME and have been since last year but these unrealistic expectations swirling around in an echo chamber are fucking retarded.
If Melvin realized a loss on GME this past quarter, wouldn’t that mean they’ve covered at least some of their shorted shares?
Gamma squeeze
Stop buying calls. The more people buy calls the longer they are going to drag this out sideways.
Go all in! Not a financial advice, I live under the Manhattan bridge.
Reason #2. Look what I can do......
lol i wish i could read this
Lots and lots of apes
Meaning that ‘true’ SI is being hidden by shorts via etfs, and ftd’s which have thus far been continually reset via shady mm / hedge options trading.  No fucking way is it 10-15%.
incestuous! what about her boyfriend?
I’m giving you the award to put emphasis on that
They already announced it. Look at their prospectus filing
They only had to reanounce because they raised the cash cap. They have had the ability to sell shares for a long time.
Mine will be a 4bt
Gme rising would most likely cause volatility all over the market, meaning it would also go up
Do the other one
One would be better off just buying GME
yeah my entire portfolio is gme and vix calls lol
I am doing this by buying UVXY call options
National Securities Clearing Corp. who settle up all positions when the hedgies can’t so that people believe the market can be trusted.  Regulated (ahem) by the SEC and bailed out by the U.S. of A. taxpayer.
Just invest part of your 401k then! I’ve got  AMC/GME shares in a cash account, HSA, and IRA.

They certainly are words.
Fail. They've got the caah-on-hand. Moreover, THEY'VE NOT PAID OFF YET, merely announced.
I have a teenage daughter so I understand that reference.
And lamp..
hello fellow ape i eat crayons can you please explain what max pain means
Ah the fun stuff
Cake!!
Sheeeeeeeeeeeesssssshhhh


Explain yourself, FUD.
Proof?
Well institutional ownership is still over 140% of the tradable float and that float is small. also there's a 20% short interest on that 140. some big boys didn't cover and short interest calculations now include the fraudulent shares created during dick in the ass shorting events
If the short was only 3.5mil shares, none of us would here.
If the stock is over 100% shorted, that would mean they would need 70 million shares to cover, and that isn’t taking into account any synthetic shares. The 3.5 million is a drop in the ocean and nothing to do with that.

In fact GME are as good as saying they want to sell as high as possible, using as few as possible shares to get their $1 billion. They are alll aboard the rocket
I told this a lot : You sir, you belong here!

But in your case I wish reddit would have a "YouBelongHere" award, I would buy it for you.
They want to maximize gains at $1B. To get to $1B, they need a share price of at least $285 ($1B / 3.5 million shares \~= $285). They'll be releasing the shares through Jeffries, and not necessarily all at once. If they do it, they will do it in an intelligent way to not crash their share price.

Besides, the fewer shares they sell off, the less the dilution for the board members and directors.
Shut up
Imagine positing in a thread about GME if you don’t like it with a snotty guided meditation troll
Neither.
190 a little low I think 420 on 420
Yo what is FactionFinancial?
No, this is completely made up and baseless.

Yes, the math of $1,000,000,000 ÷ 3,500,000 does indeed check out with the $285 figure, but it's not a "we will sell only when these two lines intersect." Instead, they are simply limiting this to $1b *OR* 3.5mil shares, whichever limit comes first. They also said "from time to time," so that means they're not doing this in one big lump sum. It can be 100k shares next week, followed by 1.5 million shares the following week, and price could be $100, $300, or $420 when they decide to sell, up to them.
It would have to go way over 285 for them to sell off 3.5m shares. Example. January when gme hit 345$. Someone quickly sold off 2million shares. Gme dropped from 345$ to 111$ to even back out at 220$ for them to sell 3.5m shares and get the price they want they need it to be higher. Plus dont quote me on this but I read somewhere you can only purchase a certain amount of shares per transaction so let's say 1million per transaction. So they are going to have to do 3.5 transactions by time they do there first 1m shares at 285 price will drop back to 180s. Just my assumption
Real Chads would release shares on the backside of the squeeze..
Whoaaaa double triangle! All the way across the graph! What does it mean?!
Inception angle
What's that?
Not only that, silver is going to THE MOON!

Forget about GME, buy Reddit silver and OG silver.
I would like to thank you for that statement. It is a wonderful statement. In fact, theres no better statement than the one you made

Yes, only from Bulgaria and only from a boy.
all over your face!
Yeah that might take of 1/10 of their shorts
That’s an understatement
The problem I see with this opinion is: Whose hype and momentum? WSB? Retail investors? 

I hate to break it to you, but we can't move markets. WSB is not some populism-fueled pseudo-hedgefund capable of driving prices from $16-$480. If we were, do you think the price would be declining right now? 

What happened was a result of the fundamentals that were already there, and people taking advantage of it. Do you think any of that has changed because retail momentum has died? Do you think that it can't happen again because retail isn't as hyped anymore? 

GME could very well be a bad play and die on us all, or it could still rocket into the stratosphere. But neither scenario will be because of retail traders. The play isn't dead because we aren't the players, we're audience.
Short it than pussy
Cultists? I just like the stock.
I’d love to hear your counter DD, or thesis, and any evidence or statistics as to why you believe this.
It's neat to see all the smoke coming out of your ass, just curious on who's cum you had to swallow to ignite that fire? Vlad's or Ken's?
Gen x here (I think, not sure cutoff,  but who cares)  I'm all in on this, convinced my kids to research and but in too.  we are all in as a family!
Doesn’t retail already own more than 70% of this stock? This is our stock. Holding forever
Nah. Gen X is the Jimmy Carter of generations.
Man, I miss Funcoland
The older millennials are here too.  Us early 80's kids grew up on NES, SNES, PS1, and computers with the analog dos speakers (I forget what it was called cause I'm drinking but there was a name for it)

We're in our late 30's, have money, and nothing but time to hold with.

Edit:  Sound blaster!  That's what I was thinking of.
I knew I wasn’t the only one....
I don't believe it. It's almost too good to be true
I only hear the Bayonetta version now.
Could you imagine if Amazon bought GameStop and transformed all of their brick & mortar stores? That’s all we really need to get to beyond the moon.
1) absolutely. You borrow a share, you only borrow the right to sell it, with the obligation to return it later. It does not confer you the dividend rights. You absolutely have to pay the owner his dividends.

2) GME did not declare dividends for Fiscal Year 2020. The last time they declared one was March 14, 2019.
Poor ape. I just tripled for 3 shares.
When the HFs hit every sell order available and they still need to buy more, 10 mil doesn't seem that far fetched.
Exactly
If they actually covered their losses wouldve way higher than just 49%
isn't it based on current holdings across the board (assets, or lack of in this case) not just capital?
Dude I know I legit posted a reminder last week to not buy calls but I fell victim to being a fucking idiot again :( hoping I can make a little on it and poor it back into shares
No, he’s got a point
Yea ik. But OP is saying that them announcing was their choice. 

I think it would illegal to not announce this beforehand.
Investors will go for gold or other tangible assets if there are big liquidations.  GME spiking is bad news for the overall market IN THE SHORT RUN.

I still like the stock .
thanks
I wanted to but they wouldn’t let me pull any money out
Hahahahahahh amazing. I just discovered him and I’m already scouting my Versace bath robes
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
You could google this you know 

https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt

https://etfmg.com/holdings/GAMR_fund_holdings.csv?=1618316310
No. It’s not. Holdings are mostly still from 12/31 you have no idea what institutional ownership is.
Thanks. Just curious. Holding my shares still...
No wrinkles.....
What do you think they're earmarked for, then?
Sure but since the date 4/20 is paired with the meeting on June 9th, I think $69,420 seems like a better price target.
My upvote was 69 nice!
We can get there fs
Theyre planning on selling at $69,420. I can feel it in my tits
That is the minimum value placed on the shares. It's certainly not going to be a block offering, but that is GME's unofficial price target over the next few years.
No one said anything about selling, so, what?
you are right, the relationship between those number is not linear. 1B is the goal, and 3.5M shares is the budget. We cant read too much more into it than that
3D doritos?
[Now that's a reference...](https://poweredbyrobotsblog.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/obi-wan.png)
A full on double triangle!
How many bananas does it require to make this triangle you speak of?
It's what Kenny G goes to sleep with every night
squeeeze on silver
Sir this is a Wendy’s
AH, IT'S IN ME EYE

AAAAAHHHHHH IT BURNSSSSS
already did going into earnings... but that could be a setup i lose :(
Retail can’t move markets but can certainly move a single small cap stock. There were less than 2M people on WSB before GameStop apes invaded. The GME float is 54M so if each of you mouth breathers buys 3 shares you own near half the float.
I’m selling options on it the premiums are insane and the price barely moves it’s amazing. I hope you retards keep it propped up as long as possible.
Theres isnt any. Never heard of any these clowns offer any counter to our dd
A failing retailer with tons of debt and only $6.5B in revenue ($220M net loss for 2020) is not worth anywhere in the stratosphere of $9B (current market cap). For reference, Macy’s did over $17B revenue in 2020 and has a $5B market cap and they actually are turning things around. GameStop is not. Digital downloads will continue stealing their business and this console cycle is already past its peak. The analyst price targets which are mostly sub $30 are correct and I’d even say they are generous.
Keep holding that bag broke bitch. Losers always lose.
1965-1980 I believe!
No
Nah...we haven’t even had a Jimmy Carter to put in office yet. Mayor Pete was the closest we got to the stage. We’re a special breed of fuck this and short positions.
Yeah...I miss having a friend that worked there. They used to throw out strategy guides and big box games in droves after they were considered last new release period. Every month I got a care package worth a thousand dollars at least. Friends didn’t play Pc. Golden era of Quake 2, Half Life, etc. never paid a dime.
Makes sense. And the fact they aren’t being made to pay them is because gme hasn’t been paying them anyway. Thanks!
I see it as a real possibility
Jesus christ I am losing brain cells
Yup. How could they be down only 49% if they actually covered ANY material quantity of a short position?

If they shorted at $20, a 49% loss would mean they covered 100% at \~29.80. We know for fucking certain they didn't think about covering at that point.
This sharp downturn before their eventual end is colloquially known as an "It do go down."
Oh yeah. I get it. Lol. I guess I misunderstood your comment intent.
I’m saying don’t pull it out. Just buy shares with the 401k as is. You won’t be able to pull the gains out until age appropriate (unless you pay the penalty) but you won’t have to pay capital gains tax like you do for a cash account. NFA just what I’ve done.
Welp. Let’s see on June then. Recent filings have shown continued buying of the stock.
This guy fucks
> That is the minimum value placed on the shares

No it isn't.

They can sell $1 billion worth of shares **or** 3.5 million shares.

It's not "we will sell 3.5m shares for $1 billion". If GME tanks to $10/share the max they could sell for at that moment would be $35 million (10 x 3.5).

If GME somehow hit 100 million a share they would only be able to sell 10 shares.

It's not them setting a price target or a minimum value on shares.
The company is selling so you don't have to
[i don't know what you're talking about](https://youtu.be/OQSNhk5ICTI)
3 bananas to make a triangle, but only 2 if one of them is long and curly.
she loved it too
That may have been true from $16-$60, but it stopped being true quickly after that. 

And your point about us owning the float has two fallacies that I see. The first being there's no way to verify exactly how many shares WSB owns. I personally doubt even half of WSB owns GME. And second, assuming we did own that much of the float, wouldn't you just be proving your own self wrong?
Lol tons of debt? Are you actually retarded?
Takes one to know one I guess, I've personally taken a liking to this bag. Seems to me someone's a sour sally
You must be new here. Stick around to lose your remaining 8 brain cells so you can get on my level
since you’re so smart what’s a “reasonable” price you think it’s going to ?
Yep this right here
I’ll look into it. My 401k is through my company and I’m not sure I have the ability to use my funds like that
Yes, but I'd bet they don't just dump it out there as op said. They know what's going on, as do most of us. Why would they jeopardize us, when they, especially Cohen, knows we are here?  

And as I stated, I have no intention of selling any time soon.  I'm good on my retirement which I can't seem to do, and I could, but this has been way too much fun.  I like extreme volatility in my life which is why I live like I do.  I'm holding.  Maybe I hit the buy button, maybe I don't.  Either way, I'm with you guys.
I’d award this but all my money is in GME
dont feed the trolls
It’s one thing to be in debt when you’re profitable and have growing revenue it’s another when your business model is failing and you are losing hundreds of millions per year. It will take them decades to pay their debt selling used game discs online.
The problem is it's quite the opposite, I've been here for a few years and watched what the $GME saga has turned this place into lol
I started trading in Jan 2021. I feel like a fucking vet now.
remember tanker gang
You're not allowed to make sense on GME threads all the new tards won't let you lol
TITLE: Kevin O'Leary Live Now thinks a second kick of life is coming to GameStop, says "If I was short that stock right now I would be worried"TEXT: “I tried to invest in GME but they didn’t want to pay me a $1 royalty for every game sold and now they’re dead to me.”
"The upside is limitless"..
I am drunk idk what I am doing, I will probably buy more GME
Smart dude this O’Leary shark
The pivot of NFLX with the cult following of TSLA. That's a BUY for me!
Meet Kevin actually met Kevin
Well okay, another 2 shares for me
Dat Kevin’s blessed eye contact
We all were taught that 1+1=2 can't let them tell us otherwise. I've done my own dd nothing can sway me now.
The price right now is irrelevant. Hold boys.
He said the price is irrelevant. Confirmation biased is biased confirmed.
I mean that's just a common sense analysis. He's not being bombastic. He's saying that long-term, this is a good stock to own and that the short thesis of driving this down to $0 is absolutely off the table. This company is not going bankrupt like they hoped for last fall.
Fuccckkkk yeaahhh!!!! Tittttssss aaarrrreeeee jaaacccckkkkeddddd!!!!
One time I was drunk at work and asked Kevin O'Leary for money and he told me to get lost. After seeing this, I believe he changed his short position in me into long, similar to his forehead once his hair began to recede.
Can the guy on the left not bust a nut with his face the whole time he's listening? It's very distracting.
Sold more APPL to get more GME today. I love this stonk!
Mr.Wonderful is very smart. Listen to him shorties
Mr wonderful!!!!
I tell you what Bobby, that Kevin O'Leary fella is smart.
Guy with the beard moves like some kind of ai generated animation
You heard it here first folks, “the upside is limitless”
He's right. The folks who claim that $GME's fundamentals didn't change much between pre-Jan and post-Jan are dead wrong, just the brand itself got much stronger.
Do you see what I seeeee
All i heard was limitless
Credit to “Meet Kevin” Link: [**www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0)
Omg yesssss. I love this guy.
After GME squeezes, us retards need to make an “Ape Tank”
About as bullish as is possible
What was Meet Kevin laughing about while O Leary was talking. That’s awkward as fuck and I’m the king of awkward.
The crazy thing is, these financial Gurus are not even aware how big GME is going to be. They follow MSM and not the DD.
Panic bought 5 more
My man said Netflix, *not* “blockbuster”. Understood.  $450 bag holders see you when we see y’all! $GME will get you back to Sheboygan
You apes are going to the moon, and while I didnt buy I  early I will cheer you on!
This is to all the fucks in denial of GME’s potential, you think you’re smarter than O’Leary? I think not.
"The upside is limitless"

Thats all I need to know. Already 100% of my net worth in Gamestop and holding to the moon.
Literally halfway through this interview right now lol
So Kevin O’Leary is in, bias confirmed, holding to the moon!!
This needs more coverage, great stuff
The comparison to Netflix is perfect.
please... come back for us apes that got in at 300
Well there goes my chance of hoping it would dip down to $40 a share again so I could YOLO some more tax return money at it. Guess I'll just have to hold tight to what I have and wait to see what happens next.
Who is the guy on the left? And where do I find his content
Bruh I almost passed the fuck out out

2 reasons:

The absolute unscrupulous incredulity of some mfs &

Seeing the truth come to light in real time is always a breathtaking affair
So, buy more GME? Got it.
In other words, he bought in
Sorry, this guy interviewing Kevin is making me very uncomfortable with he smiles and intense eye contact. Is he in the room with me?
THE PRICE IS IRRELEVANT! KEVIN FUCKING KNOWS
Dude on the left is wearing and using a pocket pussy
If they wanna draw in foot traffic at their locations, they should openly and actively advertise selling TCG cards and give more focus to card games. I know some locations already do this with Pokémon preorder cards , but they should extend it to Yugioh too. You wouldn't believe how many pissed off disappointed moments i've had going to a local Walmart or Target, only to find out the ENTIRE stock of trading cards is sold out. They even end up selling out at Game Stops that do this already too.
The pride of r/kevin right there!
That’s right shorties suck my fucking nuggets
would someone help out a baby, what is this IP he's refering to?

Thanks and to the moooooon
KEVIN!!
Upvote and share
Wow. Go Kev!
“And I’m not short” bullish af.
Just what I needed to hear
Thank you for finally calling out how this has helped GME’s brand recognition!!!!! GME FOREVER
*And for that reason, IM IN!*
Bullish AF
Another mark off on the bingo board
Like Kevin said “the pricing of the stock is irrelevant right now. If you are short, you are hurting” lol. Well said Kevin. HF fuckeries can try. We will not let go our stonks. I got 5 more at 132 today.
Look investing is all about risk/reward. The risk/reward with shorting is terrible. Max you can make is 100% which isn’t really realistic and max downside is unlimited....
Kevin has a plastic smile. Can't tell if it's because he's a landlord or untrustworthy?
whys the dude look coked out and keeps showing his teeth like some kind of Great Ape trying to intimidate
B u l l i s h  A F
Lol, dude sells out and makes ads for Robinhood, fulfills his obligation, goes long on GME and starts advertising it within the month. 

What a shark.
Confirmed - mr wonderful long GME
Got it!! Buy more!!
GME time!  They wanted the big hammer. Now it's about to drop.
'The upside is uh limitless'
GME was the stock that introduced an entire new generation to the stock market. They will be in the history books forever. Quite possibly the most infamous stock to ever exist
1. He said GameStop has been on the tip of everyone's tongues for "5 months"
2. He's saying GameStop could have a "second" kick of life? Didn't we just experience the second kick?
Beardy guy looks dumb af

Edit: I meant his beard looks dumb at. He looks better without the beard.
i hate this scumbag. i really do

but he feeds my confirmation bias so I'm willing to listen to him.
I don't like the fake Shark Tank background behind Kevin, and for that reason, I'm out.
I hate this guy and his clickbait thumbnails

I’m sorry but that bearded dudes face creeps me out big time when he’s talking to somebody. Might be a nice guy but if a dudes face looked like that and was talking to me in a bar I’d be like I need to go check something over here for a minute outside in my car and I’d leave.
This is good insight. I still have a question that I can’t seem to get answered though. How long can the dark pool be used and how will them using it affect the rocket launch? Positively or negatively... I can’t imagine it was meant to be used in this way, was it?

Edit: I can’t spell

Why does he look like a villain in a USA TV Show?
He really is Mister Wonderful.
Technically: a baby shark is still  a shark...

1200$ buying  more.
Lol ooh shit
My fav shark right here
I like what he said right at the end. The upside is limitless
Let's get this trennnnnnnnnnding baby
The pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this points
Kevin Paperhands wanted O'Leary to say "its going down", his face said it all after "the shorts are hurting" comment.
Smart man. He knows GME is gold baby
Kevin & Kevin my mind is blown
That’s the dude.. he’s a smart one.
Always loved O’Leary, he’s smart and tells it how it is
First time I’ve ever agreed with this dirt bag
Buy before the hype gets bigger. Simpsons predicted trillions.
I like how he says "and I'm *not* short".  methinks Mr. Wonderful is holding onto a slice of sweet, sweet, digital transformation pie.
You would think people would probably get the idea that shorting GameStop might not be the best idea...
You hear that? Thump thump thump THUMP THUMP,..... I hear the DRUMS OF WAR
He should be Head of Shareholder Relations
“the upside is limitless” ... ya think?!?
2 kevins, 1 dip
While I agree with what his face hole said, that guy is a moron
Note: Canadians lie too. Don't trust a word this fucker has to say.
GameStop taking over vacant malls with different games in each space, selling food and sponsoring tournaments, new game intros, interviews and music events. How totally wholesome and revolutionary would that be?????
Banana craving intensifies
"The upside is uhhh limitless."

Smooth brain ape like that.
I don't know how anyone in their right mind would think GME is ever going to get anywhere near zero.  She hits mid-double digits and retail is going to buy every last one in a matter of minutes.
Kevin o’leary is shorting gamestop in other words
We need to talk about Kevin
ive never been a fan of oleary but i respect him on this point for coming out and saying it.
“If I was short that stock right now I’d be worried and I’m not short”. 

Did O’Leary just announce his long position?
Fuck this guy. He is the reason Canada sucks. He doesn't give a shit about a regular person.
The upside is limitless!
Mandatory fuck Kevin O'Leary tho.
Kevin O'leary is a scam artist
HOLY MOLLY! HOLY MOLLY! HOLY MOLLY!
You puppets are going to fall for it again lmao
Thanks to the glorious bastard who watched this entire interview and posted the relevant parts here.
https://gmefloor.com
Kevin O’Leary takes it in the ass by Jim Cramer. No lube and swallows when Jim is done.
aka "I am long the stock but I missed the first two boats" 

F'in O'Leary, dude's been moderately successful in business (M&A in some software co's back in the 90s) and has been trading on his name ever since Dragon's Den/Shark Tank.  It's not apparent he has any other redeeming qualities (except believing in all of you of course!).
is he out on bond from when he crashed his boat while drunk and killed a father of three?
If this Kevin is doing bull promotions; it’s time to run away.
My name is Barbra and because my name is Barbara and your product is fine, I'm out. And for that reason, I'm out.
MEETKEVIN!!
the host looks like a fellow ape lel
If Kevin supports, that means he is shorting
Their faces look like they have been deepfaked
I've said it once I'll say it again. 

GAMESTOP - Turn your stores into LAN gaming centers and charge by the hour like all the LAN bangs in the South Korea <3
why is he using a green screen
Why is the guy on the left looking so gently and earnestly into the camera
Of course a second wind is coming. It’s income tax return season.
“I’ll give you $500,000 as a loan at first with 3% interest. Once you pay me back $325,000, the following $175,000 will be straight equity. However, I’d like a $1 royalty on each game sold until I reach my $500,000. I’m Mr. Wonderful! This deal is a no brainer. Oh, no deal.... you’re dead to me and someone is going to smash you like the tiny cockroaches that you are.”
“The upside is limitless”
And for that reason, I’m out
Barbara: i'm not even in this video, therefore i'm out
Two for now...
You think they're not already in it?  Duhhhh
Well instead of shark tanks, GameStop is in ape barrels and DK ready for some bananas
...and for that reason I'm out. ^^^/s
and for that reason, *I'm in.*
The limit does not exist
Drink more then buy.  You might accidentally add an extra zero or two.  Thank me later.  

*This IS Financial Advice
As long as you dont drive a boat and kill folks ;)
You’re gonna need some alcohol to chase down those tendies, so your investment strategy seems to align with market forces.
This is we why you disable your sell button
I’m waiting for my disability benefits to come in so I can buy more GME. I’m also drunk and will be again tomorrow when the market opens.
He's fucking right though.  This shit is dangerous af to short.  I was bearish overall GME but just opened a long position this morning.

That plus max pain next week shooting up...
He is a shark. He said he s not shorting but he could be buying the dips. The guy is a proven successful investor he knows when to buy stuff. It would be dumb to miss out on this
Ehhhh, his [Celebrity Jeopardy appearance](https://torontoist.com/2015/05/recap-kevin-oleary-embarrases-himself-on-celebrity-jeopardy/) says otherwise. Tough to finish almost $3k in the red, but he managed to do it. Sucks that his charity had to cough up that money to get square with Merv Griffin. /s
No he isn't. He tried to run for prime minister of Canada on a Trumpian platform.

He also may have killed someone in a boating accident and made his wife take the fall, but no one talks about that.
Mr. wonderful
O'Leary (sorry Mr. Wonderful) is a dick
Nope. He's just a [crooked shithead with a horrible business record.](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/01/26/news/real-and-shocking-story-kevin-olearys-business-career). Even his investing history on Dragon's Den was subpar at best. But he became famous for being an asshole on a reality TV show, and somehow people think he's a genius.

But, you know, this cult is going to hype whatever supports their worldview, so there's not much of a point in trying to correct you lunatics.
he could be right or wrong, but he as a person is retarded
He’s no u/deepfuckingvalue but he’s alright
He got his wife off a negligent homicide charge without a hitch too.
He's gaming the moonboys right into his hands.
Hell fucking yeah.
What does this mean!
The problem is Netflix pivoted to its own platform. GameStop can’t put its platform on any major console, the digital PC market is taken up by Steam, MS/Xbox, and Epic, And Amazon, Nvidia, Google and MS/Xbox are fighting over the streaming market.
You think the stock is actually worth 100 plus per share? Serious question.
My dude on the left is an abundant fountain of joy that cannot be contained
Ooooooogh stay frosty my friend!
We know Barbara's out though, lol. I think she literally said something along the lines of, "I like this too much and for that reason I'm out."
And I have been bleeding all day.
Yeh this has kicked me over the edge for going all in. How good are echo chambers.
I thought I *was* autistic.
His setup is actually so unorthodox, but it’s unreal.
That other dudes face the whole time was fucken bugging me out- dude was biting his face to keep from talking
Which Kevin?
I've also did my very own DD by reading all the DDs from foreigners on the internet and deciding which specifically fits my own confirmation bias the best.

Not a financial advisor. I eat crayons. Also I love the stock, not going to let go of it, actually I love it more than I love to eat, which is why I truly consider skipping my next 10 meals in order to buy more gme. Again not a financial advise.
It may be irrelevant, but I'd prefer it to be higher.
<*checks the math*>

It's good.

<*nod*>
I think he’s careful not to go so far as to say it’s a good stock to own. He clearly stops short (heh, puns) at saying it’s simply a bad stock to short. 

But he’s definitely saying the company has truly valuable assets in its IP/brand and in its real estate ~~holdings~~leases. His rationale is that they can, in theory, leverage the visibility of the brand/IP to better utilize the real estate they ~~own~~lease in a new way that drives cash flow by opening up new streams of revenue. 

He says they can “hold classes” in their retail locations, which I don’t think makes much sense lol. But his point is basically that they aren’t beholden to using that real estate for retail locations. If they do what Netflix did, and move to a digital distribution model for game sales, rather than a brick and mortar retail model, then they can utilize those spaces for something *else* to drive revenue. 

Any retarded ape can come up with their own ideas for what those retail locations can be used for. The thing that’s left out of the video is that GameStop now has new leadership coming in who realizes the value of their real estate (it’s pretty obvious that 1700 locations with 1,200 sq ft per location is valuable (edit: because those *leased* spaces can be used for all sorts of business models, not just retail video game sales)...), who understands the value of digital distribution platforms and knows how to operationalize one (Chewy is a gold standard company as far as e-commerce goes), and who likely won’t be afraid to turn GameStop’s current business model upside down (it clearly wasn’t working).  

So I think he’s right to say the current stock price doesn’t *really* matter. Of course, it does matter in certain respects, but ultimately the current share price isn’t an accurate reflection of where the company will be 6 months, or 1 year, or 5 years from now. There’s tons of potential, and that potential simply cannot be reflected by the current share price - it’s yet to be determined whether they can reach that new potential that’s opened up for them. 

Honestly, the ripple effect emanating from the movement behind GME is just starting to be felt. People are starting to see what DFV essentially saw - a company with great assets being poorly run by shitty executives. The distraction of whether the shorts/hedgies are artificially deflating the price or whether retail investors are irrationally inflating the price has run its course by now, and that has allowed people to finally come to their own conclusions about whether there is actual value in GameStop as a corporation. And it seems like a lot of people are siding with DFV now that the dust has settled.

Edit: Clarified that GME doesn’t *own* real estate, which is an important enough distinction to warrant an edit, despite completely missing the point of why O’Leary sees value in those real estate leases.
Exactly. So, why are so many people on reddit, twitter, and the media so set on getting us  to sell a good long term stock?

Nuff said.
This has been the case for a while now. Everything you see now is a function of hedge funds trying to delay the inevitable without triggering the nuke.
In short, he likes the stock.
IM JACKED TO THE TIIIIIIEEEHHHHTS!!!!!
Are you drinking now? ;)
Dude what's it like working at shark tank??
I literally had to cover his face with my thumb lmao. Wtf dude
APPL or AAPL?
Why do you hate money?
He’s Meet Kevin and he makes 3-4 YouTube videos a day and has a lair that would make any of us cream. But he spends most of his day staring at a screen.
I’d be willing to bet he isn’t, and that he won’t invest until they prove they can do what Netflix did and move to a digital distribution platform. The guy got his start selling software, he’s very anti-brick and mortar retail. It’s expensive and unnecessary overhead in his mind. 

He’s a very shrewd investor. He wants almost guaranteed bets. And right now, GME still has a very unforeseeable future. He clearly sees enough value to be confident it won’t go bankrupt, but I don’t think he’s confident enough yet to give his money to them.
You wouldn’t be seeking investment capital after receiving all those delicious tendies—they’d be seeking you
A little stock shining in the night
Is Kevin a good finance youtuber?
Think he just trained himself to alway be smiling when doing interviews and it just looks a bit forced and awkward when he does it. A lot of people get stuff like that drilled into them when learning how to do stuff like interviewing and whatnot. Though I think that's generally bad advice. Just don't look disinterested and be emotive and smile if it's appropriate, but mostly, just look natural.
They factor in things that we don't follow, like all the free goodwill (the word used as a technical accounting term) GME has accumulated. There's infinite factors in the analysis, they focus on some, we focus on others, MSM focuses on others still.

On one hand, you're right.

On the other, I REALLY don't want a large corp running LGS's out of business, and hope they never do it.

Wait, why are you buying your cards at Walmart/Target?  Find a local game shop, the prices are always far better anyway.  When I played MtG I was getting packs at 75-80% Walmart/Target prices.
Something we clearly don't have...intellectual property. He is referring to the brand name in this situation.

I love people like Kevin - because he makes no apologies for being who he is. A capitalist vulture doing exactly what the system was designed for him to do. The same with Shkreli - We need people to expose the worst parts of our system to fix the SYSTEM. Hating the kevins and martins of the world is hating the PLAYER. HATE THE GAME.
Which one? Kevin or Kevin?

He is a great lowballer, he's got more money than he can use so if he gets a deal that's near 0 risk with those terms and someone takes it he's OK. If they don't take it, he's OK too.

I got limit orders for amzn at 2678 and tsla 470 and pltr at 16.70

Really low good till cancel orders and pltr and tsla can swing down fast.  I got enough of them so if they don't hit that limit I'm happy if they do hit it I'm happy

The hype is gone on GME because the stimulus was already spent and the trade on this turd was over months ago for the day trader crowd. The general public already lost their asses and the WSBs crowd are just going to be averaging down back to 0.00 unfortunately. You can't listen to anyone in the media, especially somebody like Kevin O'leary with ties to CNBC and Wall Street. The media's sole purpose is not to inform, but to get you to take out your wallets and put money into the hands of the smart money.
You are reading more into his statement than what he said. He said it would be bad to short the stock and that he hasn't. He probably bought at $40 and is confident that the company is going to stick around and not go bankrupt. That isn't the same thing as buying it at $140 on the hope that some bizarre market thing happens to make it worth millions for "reasons".
The dude is as rich as he is because he doesn’t gamble with his money. He doesn’t need to rely on something like GME where predicting what it will do and when it will do it is an absolute shitstorm, my gut says he isn’t putting any money in. He’s just watching from the sidelines and rooting for retail because there’s nothing guys like him and Mark Cuban would love see more than greedy shorting hedge funds get shredded for billions.

This guy knows about one thing: investment markets. 

If a subject has nothing to do with investing in any regard, whether directly or tangentially, he’s not gonna know shit about it. You think he knows what year the Magna Carta was signed? You think he even knows what the significance of the Magna Carta is? The game of Jeopardy! is not suited for a man of his character. 

Now, if the categories were Keynesian Economics, Game Theory, American Conglomerates, White Collar Crimes, Squeezing Blood from a Turnip, and How to Prove Marx’s Theories on Capitalism Correct, well then he’d run the board.
This sub is hilarious. If O'Leary had said "GME is garbage, dump it now" every GME moron would be screaming "who does he think he is?!". They would downvote it to hell, dig up all the dumb shit O'Leary has done and call him an idiot.

Instead...he said something they agreed with. And therefore he is a wise man, his opinion is relevant, and we should upvote it. Literal cult thinking on the front page.
I'd trade my internet smarts for being retarded and rich

Netflix had a great business model pivot that proved out in spades despite initial backlash.  TSLA has a cult following that makes the stock price severely out of whack with their business plan.  

Combining both is the dream.
Basically in the late 2000s,.Netflix I did a similar business shift as seen with what GameStop is doing. Also, GME has a very enthusiastic base, as seen with Tesla, due in part to g*mers™ and a cult of personality of RC and the stock.

Could barely focus on Kevin. Other dude was creeping me out. Felt like that might be the face I see right before I'm tortured to death. Needs to rein in that listening face a little. Lol
I've done my own DD, using the DD of others as a reference point. Not all of the numbers add up, but a lot do as well. It's obvious there's a lot of confirmation bias out there and you have to be wary of that. But after doing my own research, it still looks to be on track for what we're expecting from it. I'm buying more friday when I get paid, here's hoping for the moonshot soon! 

Edit: Not financial advice.
This is not health advice either...
GME doesn’t own its own real estate. They lease all of that and most of it is on short term leases now, with expirations 2-5 years out. GME is many things, but a real estate play they are not. This isn’t Sears.
Yea Gamestop goes digital, use the stores for MTG, DnD etc and sell accesories or whatever

Yeah brother, it’s fishy as hell.
because a stock being a good long term prospect does not mean any price is reasonable. I'm not saying what is and isn't reasonable. but I can look at a stock, believe that company is good long term, and also not believe it's a good buy at $300 a share relative to it's earnings, or even future earnings. there is a point where it's too expensive for even a good long term company. 

Google isn't going anywhere for example. It's a good long term buy. but it's not worth $10k a share today.
Whether or not its a good long term stock doesn't change the importance of position. This is a stock that traded at $5 for years. If it levels out at $130 that is HUGE. People who were buying calls at $500 are going to have a bad time.
We are supposed to stop drinking?
Who isn't???
It's hard to know. He bashed Cryptocurrencies for years and recently came out and said that he's been invested since around 2017 or 2018 so who knows really? Definitely a shrewd guy anyways.
Can we start a new show where GME holders interview the sharks to see who we feel is better to invest in all the new companies apes will be starting?

P.S. can you imagine all of the ape-themed companies and products that will come from tendies?!?!
He's pretty solid. Tons of content, usually several videos a day. Sometimes he'd do live streams of market open, market close, interviews, and major announcements then still put out a deeper dive video all in the span of a day... All while also making daily private videos for his course members... 

He's a machine at the very least, even if you don't agree with all this analysis's. He's also very apolitical, which a lot of people like when he's reacting to how political decisions will impact the economy / market.
Thanks
Yeah, like, the smile was just so forced. No muscles moved and the eyes kept their shape, it was very uncomfortable.
He tried to be Canadian Trump. No, really. He's a fucking piece of shit just like Melvin, he just happens to be on this side of GME.

The maximum number of options expire out of the money ensuring the most possible profit from premiums by whoever sold the options
Market makers extract maximum from people speculating on price action from options (puts / calls).  In other words max pain is the price that market makers make the maximum profit.
then it’s bullet time.
There are six answers above me right now. (I counted the range as two answers). If you average them all out, you get $217.50. 

There's your fuckin DD
It was $200-$220 from what people are saying
http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME there you go
180 last i saw
Around $205.
I believe 300. 200 EOW
Depends on how you calculate it.  If you go by when calls / puts total OI are equal, yes.  But if you go by which strike they become equal in OI it is around $205.  I tend to think the latter one is more predictive, why?  Because the close to ITM MM's are most motivated to see price action, not the people who are at deep OTM extremes.
People with that much money have investment opportunities all over the place, and GME is just one of those options.  He doesn’t need to be in on it at all, or he could be in at $40, or $100, or be day trading the peaks/valleys, etc.

His comments don’t reflect anything other than “there is positive opportunity here given their brand IP value has skyrocketed, so shorting something with positive opportunity is dumb.”

Netflix's pivot was planned from the start. They were waiting for technology to catch up.  Otherwise they'd have been named DVDs-By-Mail.com.

GME's turnaround is brought on by necessity under very different circumstances.
Similar? Haha... The companies are not even remotely comparable and that was almost 15 years ago now. That's a lifetime ago in this space.

GameStop still has *nothing* that is in any way revolutionary or industry leading whatsoever. Every potential play or "pivot" they could have right now is contingent on entering markets where they're already 10-20 years behind and full of established competitors that haven't just been sitting on their asses. A big part of their main revenue stream that originally got them as big as they are was the used game market where they ripped people off for years buying used games and reselling them for huge margins of profit while cutting developers out of the picture, which only sped up the direct to consumer digital sales landscape so that GameStop and their ilk could then be cut out of the loop themselves. Moving to more of an online focus will still have them be limited to physical sales of products for the vast majority of their revenue stream as they are not a developer, publisher or even a digital delivery storefront of any consequence.

Their best bet in the next few years is shutting down as many unprofitable B&M locations as they can and aiming to become a gaming focused Best Buy and NewEgg hybrid.

I don't like digital downloads. I'll take that shit on sale, and I'll take the PSNs free games every month, but I've got 200+ PS1/PS2/PS3/Xbox360/PS4 games on disk and that means I can play them until I'm 80 years old and die

And I'll pass them on to my wife's kids along with my single remaining GME share
You are the dinosaur now...
that's a bingo!
So you're saying if Gamestop started selling porn, more people would shop there? Because that's the only reason to use bing over google, or so my wife tells me.
Bing’s video search is on point tho.  Google’s sucks.
Lmao, you can't be serious. Google revolutionized how the internet is used and has billions of customers. Nothing GME has or does is unique.
That's because when someone creates a platform on the internet, it becomes very difficult to move them to a different platform. 

That's why people bitch about censorship online. There is no other space to go. This is the public square now, and the only attempt to move to another platform was squashed by the tech industry.

Correct. They lease all their space. I work in commercial real estate leasing retail space. GameStop has been doing limp along deals the last 5+ years in their brick and mortar spaced kicking the can down the road on 1-2 year renewals. They don’t own any of their locations. That said; they can still use their brick and mortar locations differently and better than they do today.

Contract killings are available at the customer service counter, right next to the Kit Kats.
I was security so luckily got to avoid that, one of the happiest days of my life was getting to do the “we need to talk in the office” speech to one of those obnoxious fucking team leads though
I worked there and they didn't maintain their equipment so the safety latch opened and I fell out of the cherry picker 20 feet onto the cement floor of the back room. I was out of work for a year. After I returned, they fired me 3 months later accusing me of stealing. Im now part of their safety videos. Because of them I had to have my hand reattached, have permanent nerve damage in my spine, suffered with chronic pain for 20 years and I'm slowly losing the use of my leg. I'd short them into oblivion if it was possible and actually get what's owed to me.
I don't understand those enough to use that option, this is already enough risk for me at this junction in my life.  More risk would take away from my peaceful days of naps

This is the best comment I've read all day.
Uhhhh hes the only albino gyno rhino i know
It's not a coincidence, but it's also not necessarily a conspiracy either. Max pain theory basically operates on the assumption that MM will try to push the price into the max pain, so it's not like this is something "new" or unique to GME.
That's the theory, that contracts for options represent 100's of shares.  Therefore it is in their interest to buy or sell shares or influence the price closer to max pain.
That is the most important question in this subject and that is the only one all the DD didn’t answer. At least for me.
Yeah but they'll just look like huge skin balloons.
Why is max pain at $200-$220 next week?

That's just where the call and put order placements put it.

Is that accurate? Idk. I don't have access to that data.
Past two weeks it’s been around 170-150 but start of this week a lot of the call strikes doubled in open interest so that’s why the increase
help my smooth brain understand...  usually a higher put-call ratio means it's time to sell and a lower ratio means it's time to buy. correct?

Albeit 2.7 seems abnormally high..

Are you viewing the 2.7  as a contrarian indicator, buying when the ratio is above 1 and selling when the ratio is below that figure??

To provide some perspective from a long time store manager at GameStop, despite boneheaded company moves over the years, a fair majority of the stores remain profitable year over year. I started as a holiday hire in high school and stayed for a long time, spanning fifteen years. I managed four locations over the course of my time there and each one earned enough money to cover the cost of the individual store's payroll, product and utilities, in addition to generating profit for the corporation.

Things have been getting worse for years at GameStop, but overall the stores still make money and have a lot of loyal customers. Even though you can get your games online or at Walmart, the best stores had staff that were knowledgeable without being overbearing and easy to talk to. They were just fellow gamers who wanted to get excited about new stuff and geek out with you. There will always be a value to that, no matter how much of the industry moves digital only.

My point is that, try as they might, a lot of stores make money, at least enough to justify their extended existence and I don't personally see the company folding any time in the near future. I think we will continue to see certain aspects scaled back. If you've been in one recently, they cut a lot of the unnecessary shit and the overwhelming in your face marketing plastered across every spare inch of wall and shelf.

New leadership is good, but GameStop has had a lot of "new leadership" the past few years and they need a steady guiding hand as they develop a new identity or evolve into something else entirely.

I’m sure the stores make money is the corporate overhead I’m concerned about. They typically aren’t a profit center and spend more than the stores make. If they can trim the fat at the corporate level, use this new brand to their advantage and transform their revenue streams through different channels then I would say it’s currently undervalued despite the short interest.

Just remember, it’s not about what you make..it’s about what you keep!!

Good job man. Well done.

Also, how much was that cash advance when you finally paid it back? That daily compounding interest can be rough. Congrats regardless!!
Can I just give my account to one of you guys to do your thing?
Good work bro.  Been wanting to try the stock market for a long time just my anxiety keeps me from doing it.  Only have a $1,000 to my name and am currently homeless.  Seeing this has helped motivate me to give it a try.

Don’t forget capital gains tax pulls 40%! Good job tho

What was your favorite book that you modeled for this strategy?
This is thee way
Congratulations and F you!
Show me your ways PLEASE
You sir, are a lucky bastard. Congrats!
You sir are a fucking genius ...I'd be homeless or living on families couch
Sounds like losing that job was literally the best thing that could have happened to you.

&#x200B;

Congrats, you legend  


Edit: Removed the fuck you, because u did a cash advance on a credit card after losing a job. You deserve every penny you got with that kind of risk
Get outta robinhood switch to fidelity
Who needs a job with smart retards  like This.
Congratulations but that's a bit over the top to borrow against cc interest for this.  But it's life sometimes you need conviction in your bets
He's The One!
This is how you YOLO in stonks. 
10/10 this guy fucks.
What are contracts? Someone link me to an explanation. I have 5k to spend.
Wow. Good job! & thanks for sharing. It’s nice to see some ppl able to turn things around for themselves. Encouraging too.
999 updoots is not enough. Here, have my updoot +1!
Your brother must be Charlie Babbitt
Wow that's wild
how the hell do you even get approved for a cash advance while being jobless? are you god?
Nice bro...please advise!
Congrats and fuck you.
How are you doing?
Congratulations and fuck you
Sure
Go fuck yourself & congrats.
Hey wait a minute! This isn’t loss porn!
This is one of those stories where a thousand other apes lose a $5k credit advance trying to replicate. But still....fuck you, well done.
damn guuuuurl!
Fuck yea buddy
I'm a total newbie. Can I see your porfolio?
What tools taught you the most?
You should start a YouTube channel on turning pennies into millions in the stock market, lol
What’s your next move??!!!
if you havent paid that back yet then uh... do that.
Now this is the way.
Wow nice ballsy play OP!
Why pay 9% Margin Interest rates when you can pay 23% cash advance rates.
Just a amateur but what did you do to earn enough to buy so many shares in GME and Tesla?
I’m new to this. Can someone please explain the options at the bottom?
Fuuuuuuuck yea brother man
Mate share ur recipe
Good to see my man
Congrats, proving maybe sometimes it's okay to go full retard.
Your wife's boyfriend will probably let you sleep on couch now. #MovinOnUp
How does one aquire 302 shares of tesla for $5,000? I can't read or do elementary math but I call ape shit.
Fuck you but also nice
Congrats and fuck you
Well done my fellow ape!!!
Hope you paid off that cash advance!
Good job man! I don’t like margin because they can call your shares away. How much does TSLA have to fall for you to get margin call?
Good for you. Stay cash positive now and lean back a little. Play smart my friend. All’s well that ends well.
Nice! Congrats! Really hope you sold those TSLA calls it's a dangerous game holding this close to expiration lol. 

Also TSLA is the GOAT!
For you losing the job was a blessing. Congrats
Show me the way
Tesla has many great things cooking in the oven. Well done on this!
You fucker, congrats.
Congratulations, fuck you.
If I understood this correctly, you were leveraged on your leverage. Nicely done
How to call options work? I’ve read how they work, but I’m still too dumb to understand. Like this guy had like really “cheap” options for only a few dollars but seems to have made 10s of thousands. Is there really just low financial risk? But that can’t be right since I’ve seen people also lose hundreds of thousands of dollars on here. Can someone ELI5?
You fucking smooth brained Ape!
365.25 shares? Your lucky number is the precise number of spins the earth makes in a single rotation around the sun? Nice.
What kind of DD do you do if any for your picks. I'm curious. Because everytime I pick a stock no matter how exhaustively I research it, it plummets immediately after I hit the trade button and never returns. Also congrats on the tendies. Sometimes all it takes is a leap of faith and a cash advance.
Real brave man congrats
Congrats you absolute slayer
But the real question is, how much of that is due back in interest to the credit card
Seriously a cash advance to buy stock.   That's wild.  Congratulations on the win.  Lol
Fuck yeah!
Congrats!!
Awesome man. Great to see! What were some of your best plays?
annnnnd it's gone
Let me invest 5k, I wont promise much but I definitely wont promise much
Yea this is a recipe for a bright future here.
Rookie of the year candidate
yeah, if you are that low on funds you def should spend it at the strip club
You sir are retarded. A king of kings
Yeah in all seriousness people- never do this.
It true Ape style, he never paid and defaulted on the credit card advance. 

This is the way.
Thank you! I’ve cashed out 10x what I’ve put in.
"In our religion, you keep what you kill"

idk doesn't cashing out mean the compounded growth just gets slowed? just trying to figure out if i should keep my day job when im a stock trading millionaire
And I’m your cousin
Thank you!
It was zero interest for 14 months. I’ve long paid it off.
Yes, but I will lose all of it on options and bad decisions
I wish
Don’t try and hit home runs. Just get on base. You can take more risk as you grow.
I suggest using something like the paper money (fake) feature on Thinkorswim to get the hang of it. Trading with fake money means no risk, so the anxiety won't be an issue while you get comfortable executing orders and figuring out what the heck you're doing. Then when you're ready, you can start throwing down $.
>Only have a $1,000 to my name and am currently homeless.  Seeing this has helped motivate me to give it a try.

do it. there are so many strategies to making money in the market. take your time finding one that matches your natural risk tolerance.  I am a naturally cautious person, I don't YOLO much. It took me a while to get into my grove. now I am just regretting not getting in earlier. I'm up some 30% overall and I only started trading 6 weeks ago.  At this rate, I would make double my daytime job by end of year.
Be careful, a year ago was a huge dip, his timing was lucky
Damn fine work bro. Been wanting to try the stock market for a long time just my anxiety keeps me from doing it. Only have a $1,000 I borrowed from my dealer to pay back my bookie to my name and am currently homeless. Seeing this has helped motivate me to give it a try.
That’s my GME limit sell
Jan-March of this year was my best quarter.y margined is alway completely maxed out. I’m not doing smart things
Oh my gourd!

Thank you so much! I loved my old job, Covid hated it.
Don’t read or watch the news. Do your own research. Don’t wait for the perfect price. Average down. Take profits. I use a ton of margin.
Tips. Decide to risk it all when a pandemic crushes the market and then the market goes on a massive bull run. 

Any moron should have made a good chunk of money this last year.
Thank you!
Line Producer making commercials mostly in NYC. I had been researching the FED since 2018 for a movie I want to make.
Yeah I Averaged down with 8 more today.
Thank you!
Thank you!
This is the way
Thank you!
Yeah right around there
Uno Commas
Thank you!
Lololol
Don’t we all
He’s my BF now
Watch point break and big short once a week and put it all on the line.
So true
Thank you!
I will tomorrow
Thank you!
Fuck you too!
Better picks? GTFOH
Don’t spend a dollar you don’t have to and put every dollar you can in companies you believe in. Learn more about them and the market everyday.
You see pictures or just the caption?
Thank you!
I only found you guys after GME popped. I was in GME in the beginning of January Because I though it was undervalued. Had no idea what was about to happen.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
I have in the comments
Current total value is 276k in RH I have about 25k spread across other accounts I’ve started reading with since the RH nightmare
Stay disciplined and don’t try to hit home runs
Yeah I trade on margin fully maxed out and harvest losses like a machine. And almost all my expenses are write offs. I will never pay a dime in income taxes.
Thank you!
Thank you!
I still don’t feel comfortable. Reacting inversely with the news is usually my fav move. But it’s about believing in companies and then buying those dips. I buy options when everything dips.
Thank you!
You just have to believe
Thank you!
Self taught. Research companies, market cap, growth potential and pay attention. This is not passive investing. Also study the history of the Fed. Inflation cancels debt
Self taught, was studying the Fed for a movie I’m planning on making and saw an opportunity. Since I’ve just been learning as much as possible and paying attention
He told me to just invest in SPY
You should see my hog
Thank you kind sir!
RH
I’ll hold every dime that I don’t spend on a write off. Harvesting losses is probably my greatest strength.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Cut off all unnecessary expenses. Invest every dollar you have in companies you believe will grow. Research. Buy dips. Sell spikes. When something you know dropped for no reason other than the market did buy short term calls. Harvest losses. None of this is financial advice i just really like the app
Thank you! Read through the comments
Thank you and go fuck yourself
Im dyslexic. But I would say Big Short, History of the Future(audiobook), Free to Choose(audiobook and tv series), Point Break and True Romance We’re all influential.
Thank you!
Thank you!
Check the comments
Pure luck
Thank you! Just start learning about how the market works and moves. It’s not as scary as it seems.
Thanks you so much! I can’t really share this any where but here. It’s really nice to have y’all
If they give me 2.5% on margin I’ll think about it. My entire strategy is based on maxing out margin the whole time.
Don’t eat the green bananas
It was 14 months no interest. To consolidate debt. I put 20k on my existing CC debt and threw 5k on the market.
The best
Unos Commas
Invest that in shares of one of these stocks. Learn more
Thank you!
Thank you!
Credit card balance transfer
Read the comments
Thank you!
I’m stressed out but loving it. Closing on my second property 4/19. Real estate is my hedge.
Thank you for asking!!
Thank you!
I’d shake your hand before I’d lie on here
Twice today and thank you!
I’ll share some of that tomorrow
I hope they have the conviction to take that risk. With a little research and discipline it will be hard to not beat That payment on 0% for 14 months
This is 70% of it
Thank you!
Point Break and Big Short
Buy right down. Average up and down in the ones you believe it. Buy calls in fan favorites when the market drops everything. Harvest losses. Max our margin
I would love to
UPST and Sports gambling. It’s a covid recovery move for cities. Whole category is going to explode.
I’ve paid it off and then some. I’ve cashed out 10x what I put in
Thank you!
Cash advance was 0% and my margin rate is 2.5% and it’s always maxed out
I made trades. Started with 5k
Thank you!
All over the comments
Keep it simple, Jack
He’s my BF now
Read through the comments. I started at 5k in April. Cashed out 32k in Aug and then built back up from 8k in mid August,
Fair
Thank you!
Thank you!
I’m good
I always keep it completely maxed out. If I need to prevent a margin call I sell something else and harvest the loss
I’ve been 100% maxed out on margin the whole time. It’s the only way I trade
I will tomorrow. I’m always okay with anything going to zero if I believe in the play.
Thank you!
Thanks fucker!
UPST had shares since December and made 84k on 3/19 $65 calls. I’ve taken like 30k in profits on GME. In August I cashed out all but 8k and put it and maxed out margin on Tesla. I was in ROKU early. Lots a of momentum trades with Tesla especially.
Sorry this line is only for people with money move along now
...all gone
Wait what
Well done ape
Haha that what I did last night bro
Right?!
a WSB fairy tale: *goldilocks..* Nah, *Cinderella*, ok, whatever...

I dunno if you have any accountant friends but if so you can chat them up about tax planning etc

and if you can name your gorilla, how about **Mastercard** the silverback?  Unless it was a Discover card...
did not expect a Chronicles of Riddick reference in 2021. Well done.
Username checks out.
Lol. I bought 150 year old house and am fixing it up with my wife while I try to do this for a living.
It does for sure. But if this type of stuff is your sole income it’s better to be a little safe and have some cash on the sidelines. 
Just in case you need money for something..or want to take advantage of the dips!
but it locks in gains, which is how you prevent yourself from being GUH'ed out of existence
And I'm his 3rd cousin twice removed
0% interest on a cash advance? Never heard of that. Usually they’re like 25%
When I say 'one of you guys' I mean these '5k to 200k in a fucking quarter guys.'
Did you start out by spreading it around and taking small profits or investing heavy in one or two things?
I hit lefty, ran to third, then got yelled at. Got a hit so that’s good, right?
I’m going to head to the bank tomorrow to reopen my account.  Sucks I’ll have to wait a week for the card but I’m finally ready to give it a try.  I don’t exactly know what I’ll do but I’ll just do as much research as possible.  I have nothing left but time so I should put it to good use. Thanks.
I’ll have to look into this.  I’ve never heard of it, but thanks - I’m downloading it now!!
That’s impressive.  I had a health issue put me on my ass about a year and a half ago which is why I’m currently in this situation.  But the stock market has always been a interest of mine for many years.  I’ve always looked at people like warren buffet as a role model so I’m definitely at the point in my life where I’m ready to try to walk the path of those I used to look up to when I was younger and see where it takes me.  Good luck with the rest of your trading.  Hope it all goes well!
I've been in about 6 weeks also. I'm only investing $100 a paycheck. I'm down $15 and its infuriating.  Ive dove into everything I can find trying to learn. Are you day trading? I have concluded swing trading works best for me right now. I haven't dove into options yet. Want to build up more.
I've lost my 1000 the last two times I saved up and put it in. 

Feels like I'm cursed.

My gf is super pissed at me, as I keep talking about trying to save for a house.
Just wait for the next dip
I'm down 9% over the last 6 weeks. I have a uncanny ability to pick losers. 

I'm up about the same in crypto over the same time, so at least there's that.
I’ll be careful for sure.  I’ll take all the time I can to think out what I’ll do.  I know without a doubt it will be a slow climb if Im lucky enough to make it anywhere at all.
Oh sorry, tought they fired you for any other reason... Anyway, keep on doing what you are doing, u gained very well gj
Ngl get off RH if you want to do this for a living.
You use a ton of margin on stocks or options? The balls on this guy
When we do our own research what should we use if we're supposed to ignore the news? Sorry just new to stocks and trying to learn!! (Obligatory: congrats and fuck you)
Good run then:) am just getting started and i am a bit afraid but hey...i lost my job too last year, luckily i have some money on the side. I did make money paper trading but i can bet my house its not going to be the same with real money. Congrats anyway !
How?
Show me a pay stub and I quit my job right now and work for you.
The tequila isn't quite as good
Point break is such a good movie
Good luck and greatz...I started with 137k in January now I have 80k lol
I’m offended please cash app me to make up for it ahahahahhahaha, no rly, fuck you, you beautiful money making bastard.
Welcome to the shit show then lmao im just saying Don't always ride the hype plays
Well I can't see below options hence my question. I'm on mobile btw
Can u hit me up with  a rocket
Do u have any advice to get started.  Ive been learning a bit because i have a tax free investment due to a disability wholich has sort of forced me to learn a tiny bit thru a financial advisor but i rather do my own stocks when i max that option out!
This is amazing thank you for responding. Any particular resources that helped more than  others? I know there is like a guide for investing on one of the fed sites
Leveraged your wife too lol
Whoa that’s rich
I don't know if that's ghey bear slang or you bought a Harley... electric I hope
Well done, sometimes you need to take chances in life to make any meaningful change.  Looks like you did
I have 7 TSLA shares. Guess I need more.
Done!
Ayyy my siblings and I are in the process of looking into buying some joint rental properties together too. It’d also be my hedge.
Jesus man lol yea he’s legit, that’s bold
Thank you sensei.
That UPST is pricey but if your in...
Dang.  Margin at 2.5?  Who is your broker?
Yeah but what'd you get into because that's already a win with the amount you made.
Fair enough. Congrats bro. I thought I hit a Homer buying nio at 1.90 and 3.10 in 2019 and April 2020 lol. 2700 to 63,000 in January.
What does harvesting the loss mean?
Jupiter Ascending. I do my own taxes I won’t pay a dime in income taxes. Discover
Wow I gotta re watch that.
Seems like you are doing; not trying.
The house that Tesla built
That’s awesome, I’m happy for your bro. Good luck with the house!
Hi.  Will you be my dad?
With your wife... and her boyfriend right?
My low risk investments are the same as cash on the sideline. I’d rather have 10k in APPL than in my account
What was removed twice from his cousin ?
When you open a 0% CC they usually offer you a balance transfer at 0% for 12-15 months. Instead of transferring a balance you can just transfer your CC’s line of credit into your checking account. I did it with 3 cards last year. 2 to consolidate debt and one for this.
Same here man. But I guess it's gonna be sweeter if you out in the work. And bitterer if we lose it all.
I put it in Amazon, Wendy’s and Roku to around 4/10/20 to start. Amazon made no sense falling that much. I knew Wendy’s was sustaining 90% of there business at drive thru and I think they have the freshest fast food. ROKU because they were built into the number one selling TV on amazon and I figured they had a user advantage on streaming.
Good luck!
Check out r/options - lots of good research posted on a lot of different companies. Can help you get an understanding. Wouldn’t necessarily copy their trades though.
You can very very easily lose that $1000 on volatile stocks
another tip I found. Its easier to make money with more money. but  please only start using more after you have played and mastered your preferred strategy with a small throw-away amount
If being down 15$ infuriates you, options is most definitely NOT for you.
at small amounts, it's harder, but not impossible,  to make money because you have so little room for mistakes.  Even if you get into a good sitaution, you don't have enough to fully take advantage of it. just keep using the small amount (and whatever margin is available) to hone your preferred strategy and until it's making money relatively consistently. Once you feel comfy with your strategy, try it with larger amounts.I generally won't advise options for beginners with playing with small amounts, unless you are into YOLOing.
I agree. this is one of the better starter strategies, especially when you are not trading with much. buy and a trade a few small shares, but keep your cash ready waiting for major bear days, buy the dip, hold for a few days, easy profit.
thats a heckuva skill. can you pm me your moves each morning, so I can buy puts
If I can find 2.5% margin I will. My whole strategy is based on constant maxed out margin
I’ve kept my margin maxed out the whole time
Follow a company. Learn what it’s doing. Learn about the sector. Learn it’s value in that sector. UPST Had announcements during the feb dip and it dipped as fast as the spac’s. It’s a legit company. 10x in 5 years easy. I knew it was going to pop on earnings and threw down on some calls. 84k on one play. Don’t buy news
Yeah I had 30k in CC debt and an overpriced brooklyn apartment. I had nothing to lose.
Read the comments
I have taken screen shots on 70k and 72k months just for that reason.
Fear causes hesitation and hesitation causes your worst fears to come true.
Oh wow! I’m
So sorry. Keep averaging down shares and hold
These are long positions I’m currently holding. Ride the hype.
Both
Are u still holding
Look for companies with room to grow in big popular markets. Average down. Don’t try and time the market.
I pay attention to everything mainstream and then I trade without emotion. It’s mostly instinctual after I understand a company and it’s sector.
I’m now shopping for an electric Harley
It’s been a rocky road
I had 7 in July
Thank you!
Great move
It’s in sale
I’m not sure what you’re asking
Great Job!
How?
Thank you!
Just bats
We’re a generation of men raised by women. We had no Great War, no Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual warfare are Great Depression is our lives.
He lives in my glory hole closet
Oh smart thinking. So you cash advanced one card and then transferred that balance to a separate 0% card.
You’re so right
OMG and it's Wendy's. New MVP right here..
Mods get this man some flare
Sir this is a Wendy’s

Common sense investing !  Get down credit card advanced Mac daddy !
This man likes the stock
This right here is value investing based on smart logic.
Maybe I missed this but did you buy stock or long term calls or what were you doing?
How many hours a day do you think you spent just thinking about and strategizing your Trades?

EDIT: To clarify "thinking about" I mean research.
I just joined that community, thanks Tzorn!!
That’s one of the reasons my anxiety has prevented me from trying it in the past.  But I’m going to start very small and don’t expect to turn millionaire overnight.  Living like I have over the last year-ish has made me truly understand the value of what little I have.
Explain this strategy please?
Hmm that is a pretty aggressive rate they are giving.

Interactive broker should be able to match but if that's what you're looking for then it's probably not worth moving.
It makes sense that it worked during the biggest bull run, if you started investing literally at the bottom.

I'd say count your blessings and swap up your strat... but its your money, not mine.
lol wow
This is the way
Been in NY twice.. awesome city but it is insanely expensive. How did you start trading? Swing..day ...long? Any advice?
lol
point break which year?  1991 or 2015?
Yeah I averaged down on most hopefully by end of year it will make profits. Only thing green currently is my 7 PLTR strike 10 LEAPS
These are current positions tonight.
Thank you very much.
I’m in..let’s do it
By not paying them.
Didn’t say he’s not required to pay taxes he said he’s not going to. It’s the ole retard loophole. 90% of the time it works 100% of the time.
I trade with margin maxed out and make lots of mistakes. I harvest losses like a machine. 90% of my expenses are write offs. I have always had 3 jobs. I’ve never paid a dime in income tax.
Good luck with your home and your portfolio!!!
Yup
I love wendys
Thank you!
Thank you!
You should read my other comments
I’m explaining all over the comments
I harvest more losses and am able to never cut into my long hold’s. I’m constantly trading. There’s so much momentum. All in all the time. Take losses as often as you can.
It’s all I care about
If I’m actively investing I’m all in. I will happily trade a +/- 5% position like it’s cash on the sideline.
I watched the market after Covid and looked for value. Then I continued to pay more attention and research and find more and more value. I kept my margin maxed out the whole time and made a lot of risky moves. You gotta be able to handle the swings. Plenty of days where I’m down 25-50k.
JFC the only remake of Point Break is Fast and Furious
Those could be huge
Buddy that's awesome
What a big brain move lol.

IRS gets theirs tho. Guy makes it sound like there's some magical way to not report cap gains tax cuz he does his own taxes but for other retards reading, pay uncle sam on your gains else the penalty just adds up.
Something doesn’t add up with you. You keep using that word... I smell bs.
Thank you!
Dudes smart as shit even outside the stock market. Well done
Good job. Congrats on the gains.
Baconator is the best fast food hamburger of any establishment, hands down.
my number one
No no, thank you. Dave Thomas would be proud.
Plenty of days down 25-50k...this sentence i felt it in my stomach....uh...all the best and keep up the good work !
Bro you’re doing it wrong. If you make the right kinda trades then you actually get to write them off instead of paying them. You just aren’t making the right trades my friend.
I would shake your hand before I would lie on here
Thank you!
Thank you!
I’m a JBC man myself
My stomach is a mess
If you have a big enough loss, you can easily offset your capital gains, thereby avoiding taxes

Checkmate, IRS
Do please elaborate, unless you are talking about writing off losses or shorting companies to bankruptcy
Nah thanks. Please stay 6 ft away. :)
legend
yeah but you can afford all the omeprazole you need, right? ) your story is awesome.
Yeah I get prescription 40’s for like $2 a months
