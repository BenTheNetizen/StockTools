Been investing for about four years now. I have a fairly global portfolio with stocks from different countries and I am focusing on growth in five different, what I call, strategies. Tech, Health, Consumer, Financial and Industrial. This might be a fairly long post but I thought since the broad masses here probably don't know some of these companies I thought I'd make it a bit more comprehensive than just posting some tickers and percentages.

Below I have listed the companies, how large a % of my portfolio they are, what country their HQ is located in, what strategy I put them in (see above), what their market cap in billion USD is, my unrealized gain (currency effect), gain of first purchase price (no currency effect) and a very brief description of their business.

Sorry for the long post, ask me if you are wondering anything about my strategy or companies!
This thread is dead as fuck. Why are we posting here at all?

The mods sticky GME meme threads and let the real discussions die here.
AAPL 100%
26 years old, 25-30 year outlook. Trying to have some measured aggression so it’s mostly a mix of blue chips and ETFs that I think will be strong over decades.

Individual stocks (40%):

* 15% APPL

* 10% MSFT

* 10% DIS

* 5% NIO

ETFs (60%)

* 20% VTI

* 10% QQQJ

* 10% SMH

* 10% ARKG

* 5% ARKF

* 5% PRNT

In 10-15 years I plan to restructure these to be more conservative but for now I’d like to be more aggressive  to start compounding that wealth early.

Also important to note that I get 10+10% 401k matching from my company separate from my personal investing so I can be a little more aggressive with my personal portfolio.
ETF’s: VTI (2.29%), VXUS (2.43%) 
I want to get these each to 5% so they account for 10% of my portfolio. 

Stocks: AAPL (5%), HON (4.74%), BRK.B (4.66%), JPM (4.53%), ZG (4.08%), NEE (3.67%), APPH (3.38%), NKE (3.33%), AWK (3.28%), DKNG (3.08%), WMT (2.96%), FISV (2.88%), PLUG (2.56%), ABBV (2.57%), NIO (2.58%), GM (2.63%), AMD (2.48%), BHVN (2.35%), O (2.4%), SONY (2.33%), VZ (2.25%), GE (2.21%), WFC (2.23%), C (2.12%), PLTR (2.03%), AZEK (1.97%), KBH (1.92%), KTOS (1.63%), CMCSA (1.56%), ORCL (1.56%), MOS (1.5%), ADM (1.52%), OPEN (1.28%), OZON (1.26%), TECK (1.26%), CGC (1.21%), AJRD (1.18%), NOK (1.08%)

I know that I have a lot of stocks. Don’t respond with the typical “that’s too many just buy an ETF”. I’m basically trying to have my own ETF where I pick stocks and try to beat the indexes. It may not work, but that’s my plan. I also have two ETF’s I will add to to further diversify and minimize volatility. Please evaluate my diversification and quality of the stocks I’ve picked.
Relativly new trader here, how bad are my choices?

* TRMB
* TWTR
* QRVO
* Z
* NXPI

* PLTR

On my watchlist to add to my taxable account:

* MongoDB

* Exact Science

About $7000 in bitcoin (blockfi doesn't really tell you what your total gains are). Initially put down $3000 when it's was around $40,000 and put $500/month into my blockfi account buying $20 worth every day.
There's a lot of talk about diversification lately due to the tech selloff.  While I agree that diversification is a good thing, I also believe in investing what you're familiar with. I work in tech and feel like I have a good grasp on the comings and goings of companies in the field.

In my opinion, diversification for the sake of diversification can be a bad thing if you're blindly investing in "boomer" stocks without actually knowing why.

As an example, these are the top 10 holdings in my portfolio based on % of account.

Symbol | Gain/Loss % | % of portfolio
-----|-----:|-----:
AMZN  |  +150.45%  |  18.05%
GOOGL | +133.97% | 12.17%
MSFT | +153.76% | 12.14%
NET | +302.07% | 5.05%
AAPL | +55.76% | 4.6%
ZG | +287.93% | 4.45%
TMO | +52.78% | 3.26%
ZTS | +31.35% | 2.93%
USAC | -4.89% | 2.39%
ABT | +58.1% | 2.26%

The top 6 are straight up tech stocks, while TMO, ZTS and ABT are in the pharma/scientific/bio sector. Of all the above investments, USAC was sort of a gamble.  I was up pre-pandemic but it's still recovering from the March 2020 crash.

A few notes on my investing style:

* I buy and hold. 

* The only time I sell is if I lose faith in the company or if the stock is a letdown (multiple percent loss) and I don't see a recovery any time soon.

* I keep about 1% of my cash available for riskier investments which I'm ok losing on if they don't pan out.

* I only set stop-losses on investments I'm starting to lose faith in or ones that were a risky purchase that aren't performing like I hoped.

**tl;dr** Invest in what you know, and if you feel like you're too holed up in one sector, do the research and make sure you know why you're investing in a company outside of your knowledge zone.

I have 30% outstanding still to invest. I'm thinking of a CRISPR tech related stock, but any other suggestions welcome (preferably with short term catalysts, as most of the above are long term)...
Uber new investor here - was thinking of buying the following with a third of my savings (will still have enough to survive any unforeseen situation for at least 1 year). This is money I don't plan of taking out in the next 5-10 years at the minimum.

*     AMD
*     MSFT
*     AAPL
*     DIS
*     HIVE
*     VGRO.TO
*     ESPO
*     VOOG
*     QETH.UN.TO
*     BLOK
* HBLK

The plan is to spend whatever extra money I make after buying these and have to spare in a relatively stable ETF since my individual picks are all done.

I'll be spreading the money pretty evenly in all the following. Wanted to keep it tech + crypto focused.

Any suggestions/ideas/feedback? things I should be watching out for?

Please, all feedback is greatly appreciated. I just started investing early Feb '21. My biggest concerns are diversity and balancing risks. I made a lot of mistakes (still am) but feel like I'm at least learning. Lost some $$ on APHA like an idiot. After I dumped that I'm now up +0.39% overall over the past month or so.

I'm in college and able to invest most of my income from my full time job. I have a long time horizon and am interested in Innovation and Artificial Intelligence.

I put 1/3 of my money into a Roth IRA and 2/3 in a regular brokerage account. The Roth IRA is entirely ETFs because I want to spend time on individual stocks in my regular account and be more passive (possibly safer) with my retirement.

18 years old and only been investing for ~7-8 months.

I am definitely going to rebalance my ETFs to decrease ICLN and ARKK and increase VXUS and QQQ. I may even add a tiny amount of TQQQ just for fun. I may sell the mutual fund and take the profits as I discovered that I prefer ETFs. As for the stocks DIS and BB are longer term, but DAL is more of a Covid recovery.

Any suggestions are appreciated!

I got the modified example from the swenson model replacing bonds with tech for an aggressive portfolio. I have been happy with it and won't change it. All are up and making me money. 

Started this in March 2021 after liquidating my only mutual fund and started this instead. Within a month I am green in return of 1000. I will update after a full year has passed.

Hi all! Started investing about a year ago. Strategy is more centered around growth/long-term holding with some decent dividends along the way. Am new to this and am willing to learn. Open to feedback on how I can improve.

SQ = 3.6%

TMO = 35.1% (have been consistently investing in this stock since 2019 and have seen great returns)

VOO = 5.8%

VTRS = 0.5% (aquired when Pfizer spun-off Upjohn with Mylan)

WFC = 12.5%

Z = 4.1%

I'm considering investing in JPM, KO, or DIS, or adding to my WFC or my current tech stocks and injecting more into the ETFs to diversify more as I know that nearly half my portfolio is in pharma. Also considering Let me know your thoughts! Thanks
 Hi, I'm 18 y/o super new to investing and don't have the most knowledge yet and had some questions. I'm working full time with a job that offers a Roth 401k. How should I go about putting money into this? Try to max it out ASAP and focus on this only? Or should I be investing in other things like ETFs, REITS, and individual stocks as well?
25% each for 
QQQ 
SPY 
BND
TLT. 

If I expect QQQ to outperform SPY, this portfolio gives me about the same returns as SPY but with half the drawdown (did some simple back testing)

I can sell my bonds during market crises and buy into SPY or QQQ. Having 50% bonds seems like a lot but it helps me fight volatility which I really don’t like.

Hey guys, I got some advice not too long ago for managing my retirement fund to focus on a 50-25-25 split between VTI, VYM, and BND. While this looks great for the domestic market, I'd like to fit about 15% worth of international investments in there as well. Any recommendations by chance?

Holding: Tesla, Facebook, GM, Dell, Disney and the SP500 ETF.  
Reasons and future thoughts:  
Tesla: Hold and buy/sell some other stocks following the fluctuation, trying to buy low and sell high. I think Tesla has huge potential in EVs and Solar.  
GM: Same about EVs. The Hummve is awesome and so far I've been trying to balance tradicional automakers with newer companies, at least while EVs aren't the majority of the cars.  
Disney: Parks are opening soon and Disney+ is a success. My only regret is not buying more at the dip.  


My biggest question is regarding Dell and Facebook. I really want to sell at least FB since I'm having a hard time trusting the social media, I bought it because of Instagram and Whatsapp. So I want to switch Facebook for a semiconductor company like MU or AMAT. Which one would yall recommend? I'm also considering selling both FB and Dell so I could buy both semiconductor companies but Im not sure if that's clever since I want to diversify.   
Future wallet outlook:  
Facebook turns into MU or AMAT  
Dells turns into a software company, that way I always have 1 hardware (MU/AMAT or Dell) and a software company (Facebook or MSFT or GOOGL) and can diversify.  


Any thought on how to improve this portfolio?
Big tech stocks have been good to me during several years of buy-and-hold, but now I'm pretty tech-heavy.  Tech is 33% of my total portfolio, with MSFT and AAPL each over 10%.  I also have Vanguard funds and etfs that have holdings in MSFT and AAPL, so it's probably closer to 13% each.  Unrealized lt cap gains are around 90% of my MSFT and AAPL.  I'm thinking that I should sell some of those holdings to invest in ev, renewable energy, biotech, etc.  Should I just sit tight with my happy big tech positions, or take a tax hit to diversify?
holdings largest to smallest. SPY, VTI, MSFT, DISNEY, RYCEY, WMT, AWAY, CVS, F (asshole)

My new mid/long portfolio after completely purging my n00b wsb portfolio that one Friday a month ago, sold the bottom. I deserved it. Looking to add some banking and maybe restaurant/food catering stuff if anyone has any good suggestions on etfs or individuals.

Looking to get back into some tech now that my wash sale period is up but waiting for good entries. Now could be a good time, but ehhhh. Still have a little ptsd.

Hi!

37 married, homeowner, household income ~120k/yr.

Wife has a 401(k) through work that we max for the match, I have a state pension. 

Aside from that, I recently (whoops) opened a Roth IRA and 2 brokerage accounts, 1 with fidelity, 1 with Robinhood.    


My split for deposits is 90/10 - 90% into the ROTH/Fidelity and 10% into RobinHood for yolo plays.

Of the 90% going into long positions I have...

80% going into ETFs    

IVV 75% (20% of this allocation goes to QQQ)    
ARKG 10%    
ICLN 5%    
IJH 5%    
BOTZ 5%    

10% Individual Stocks (mostly tech favored..)     
10% Crypto     

Does this seem like a solid strategy for a MOSTLY set it and forget it with enough diversification and value? 

I'm behind when it comes to individual investing but thank goodness I've had a state pension and wife's 401(k) in the meantime. 

Thanks for any thoughts/critiques.
Early 30s, working for a not for profit for several years is really opening my eyes to how little I make and it terrifies me for the future.

Can someone share their thoughts with me on this?

I've sold my Tesla and Nvidia, and incurred a decent profit. With the rest of my stocks, $50k in total left; my gain is only around 3% at this time - which doesn't justify the potential risk if my holdings drop even further. They were much higher in Jan 2021, as most things were - and never recovered from the drops in Feb/March.

With fees, I will break even if I sell everything. I can either sell and distribute evenly among some ETFs I want to get into, plus some blue chips (safe play) - or wait it out until my portfolio rises again, then sell and redistribute (uncertain/riskier).

I'm 21 and I've mainly been trading for the past year. I've got about half the value of my stocks worth of cash on hand. I'm saving up in case of a major market pullback, but I am also looking at adding some more established large-cap growth and security names. 

Thinking of adding small amounts of WMT/COST, AMD/NVDA, AMZN, VZ/T. Also planning to get back into CRSR when I feel it is on better footing.

Thoughts? Any other names you'd look at? I'm not usually one to solicit advice from strangers on the internet, but I enjoyed reading the other posts on this thread and I thought it would be a good opportunity to evaluate my holdings.
Currently in a roth ira-

Currently NIO and two tickers who cannot be mentioned here (backwards being OGNB and MDNN) are killing me, the latter two more so than the former. I am comfortable holding NIO long-term, but I suspect I may have tried to catch falling knives and am currently bagholding the latter two. Only time will tell, as I don't want to sell until I see how they do in 2021 (unless obvious and drastic news comes out confirming them to be lost causes). 

Those are what I consider to be my 'speculative' stocks, alongside UMC and BMBL. The rest are dividend stocks, except for AAPL's and MTCH. MTCH was intended to be a hedge against BMBL (as they pretty much have the online dating market to themselves, so if one fails the other should rise, maybe?), while AAPL just something I thought would be a good buy at the current prices, especially with talks of their own EV floating around. 

I wanted to nab some Lucid Motor stocks (another ticker that cannot be named) in the 20-25 range, but it refused to dip that low so far, now back up from 28-29 to 31-32. I still think it is currently a bit overvalued, though, and thus am waiting it out. Aside from that, what else would you recommend I spend my remaining cash allocation on, preferably to diversify as I am pretty much just in tech and real estate at the moment... 

Thank you for your time and feedback!

So, I'm fairly new to all this but after a couple months, I've still got a lot to learn. 

I'm 30 years old and am trying to save everything I can. I've got an e-fund I'm building up and a regular investment account. I've got about $4000 in my investment account. Would it be wise for me to transfer that into a Roth IRA right away or should I just start to contribute to the IRA now? I know the limit is $6000 which is why I ask? I hope that makes sense. Thanks guys

Posting intended portfolio before investing:

30% bonds because I may need that money in a few years to pay back student loans so it has to be low risk. 

* 6% bfly

* 10% bynd

* 8% cgx

* 6% Canadian graphene split between nou and grat

* 25% icln

* 5% (a Canadian "microcap" but I swear I just like the company and did my DD) 

* 10% sdg or susa, need to do more research

I'm a hippie and need to know my money is going to things I actually want to fund. I'm not sure if these % make sense, I figure I should be big in etfs I like, and the rest can do into more aggressive specific companies that I see big growth in but are admittedly more risky. I'm also Canadian, hence some of these being Canadian.

I can't shake cgx going big in a few months after vaccines roll out, but it doesn't really feel like it belongs. I want to go more into graphene, it's showing steady growth and one of these companies is liable to explode in a couple years. That said it's hard to justify more given how much I like the rest of the portfolio.

Roast me.
I've been investing for approx. 2 years, but have been more active lately. Additional discussion welcomed on a few tickers in particular:

FWRD - transportation company, solid financials, weathered the covid crash and has been on a strong rebound since last spring.  My first purchase and longest held and largest position. 

NVDA - ticker needs no introduction. I was lucky (not good) to hear about it on youtube two years ago. Put some money in and have been letting it run.  Increased my position last month when it slid below $500/share.

F - I am reevaluating continuing to hold this.  I don't see a path to them acquiring a larger market share with most car companies moving toward electric vehicles.  I can get out at a profit and may do so.  There are other car companies (VWAGY, HYMTF, RACE) that have better prospects. 

M - I bought Macys on the run up (@$18/share).  Seemed like a good play at the time, retail should do well with things opening back up, but it has slid back down.  Am I looking at things wrong or is it undervalued? $4 billion market cap for a company with 18 billion in revenue and $2 billion in profit during a pandemic? Planning to keep holding for now.  

RKT - I bought and sold during the meme spike last month, got in right as it was taking off, @$24 sold @$38 and made some coin. Reinvested on the way back down, @$25, but it has continued to slide. Am I looking too hard at $2.6 billion market cap on $15 b in revenue/$4 billion in profit?

VACQ/GNPK - these are speculative plays, SPACs that are taking Rocket Labs and Red Wire public. Commercial satellite launch and space infrastructure.  

Rounding out the profile a couple ETFs, ONGAX and PRDSX, and some more stocks:

WMT
LMT
KBAL
T
ERIC
SELB
LUMN
BDN
UNIT
PLTR 

I also have a little in a gold equity, IAU. Am looking to diversify more into Agriculture/Energy but not sure yet.
I'm on Fidelity with a normal brokerage cash account and I am 21 years old. All stock portfolio since I can afford to lose and plenty of room to grow. Started with a initial investment of $1500 and plan to put in $100 monthly. No debts; Currently on my third year of computer science so monthly deposits might increase as soon as I graduate and get a job on the field in the following years. I estimate these investments to last til 2030 but I might change my mind if compound interest starts adding up and is more profitable for me to keep my money in for a longer term.

FTIHX 30%

It's a lot but again, any suggestions/advice would be much appreciated!
I am a tiny investor who is using two brokerage accounts with different amounts to play/learn. Maybe at some point I will have learned enough to suggest a plan.

E\*Trade: I have just enough here to make a few small plays:

* AAPL: I made some money here Dec-Jan and then took gains.  I bought back in after a drop and it has been fairly horizontal since then.  There is not much to be said by me about a FAANG stock.
* BXRX: I found this tiny stock using screeners.  In E\*Trade I bought Sept calls.  I have some high hopes for those.  More on this one below.
* MRSN: Another screener find, this small cap seems like it has a strong upside, but since buying in it has been flat to down. 
* STIM: Another screener find, this small cap seems like it has a strong upside, but since buying in it has been flat to down.  I think I will find an exit plan here.
* TMUS: I forget how/why I bought T-Mobile.  I think maybe based upon my personal experience with them and expectations for how they will be doing.  They are up 6% for me so far and I don't see any reason why I shouldn't hold them for the foreseeable future.
* TRIT: I think I found this using screeners too.  I currently have a few shares and a Dec call. I expect (hope) this one will jump someday.  But maybe I got sucked in with false hopes. I don't know. I have a limit order to sell my shares, but can be patient for the call.
* WMT: WalMart... I have a lot to say about them.  This is a company everyone knows so they figure they can guess how their stock will do.  I don't think I could have been more wrong.  I bought a couple shares, then sold those for a loss.  Thinking it must recover soon I bought a call.  I have only a couple weeks left for that call and it is pretty dicey now.  I've learned that this one changes very slowly fairly consistently.  Apparently that means that one should use Iron Condors on it.  I could not say yet.  I guess I need to learn how to do those with paper trading before trying them out for real.  Once my call is done, so am I.
* LOW: I recently sold to take profits.  Maybe I should have held, but of this list I have done best here. I keep an eye on it and may buy back in.  HD and LOW track very similarly and were one of the best buys out there just after the covid crash last May.

Webull: I use this app for watching and commenting on the stocks, with a tiny amount to play with.  But my choices, so far, have been abysmal.

* BXRX is my primary obsession here and I actually want to sell all other holdings to focus on this one.  It has been a bit of a roller coaster, quite the opposite of Wal\*Mart.  For that I started buy/selling 20% at a time.  The result is both averaging downward and taking small profits.  One article on this described this one as "a falling knife you might want to catch". I like to buy stock that has dropped recently but looks like it should bounce back.  That's how I got started.  Now I call it my bouncing ball and it seems like I choose to buy or sell almost once a week. The few analysts that have price targets here suggest an upside of about 250%.

My lessons learned so far:

* Don't just pick a day to buy/sell shares.  Use my watch lists to trigger inspirations one security at a time.
* Don't buy calls unless it is a good day to do so, which typically means that there was a drop in their price.  Use limits to find those drops. Don't pick a stock that never moves quickly.
* Always have more cash on hand. This is a lesson learned long ago when I briefly did quite well with call options.
Just started like a month ago, still changing my positions. Looking to buy some ARK etf. Interested in PINS, SDGR, SE, COUR, SQ.

Currently: (invested 15k at the moment)

Hi. how can i recommend a free shareholder google sheet template without the AI moderator deleting my post
Question: if I were to purchase a call option on APHA with an exp some time in May and the acquisition goes through with TLRY before that time, the shares will be .83 on the dollar and convert to TLRY shares, would that mean that there would only be 83 TLRY shares in the contract now or would the contract be voided? Also, would the strike price change the same way as the shares?
Relatively new to this. All in IRA, not counting dividends reinvested. 

Single Stocks:
So far, just 4 shares of T (I know, I need to diversify my actual stocks)

ETFs and Mutuals Funds:

DGRO - 2 shares

SPYD - 3 shares

Know I need to build up my single stocks a bit for sure but other than that not sure which direction to go.
I’ve mostly completed a re-vamp of my portfolio. It was far more risky, but I’m attempting to have a portfolio that’s still somewhat aggressive, but not overly so. I plan to shift more into VTI just to anchor everything.

Initial thoughts?
As of 4/6/21.  I'm still in the red with a lot of my stocks. But I'm in it for the long haul. Thinking of adding some AMC. Waiting for all the ARK funds to go into the green to see what I should do with them. Let me know what you think I should do. Should I buy more of anything before we complelty get out of the dip. Sadly I bought a lot of my stocks before the dip.  I'm still pretty new at all this. Slowly learning. These stocks are in a Roth IRA and a regular account. I'm 42, I started late but trying to catch up.  Any opinions/tips would be greatly appreciated:)

Dunno if this went thru last time because I had a company with a small market cap. I took it out now.

Just turned 31 a couple weeks ago. Fell for a lot of the hype and lost a little, but now trying to recoup and invest smart. Any tips help. Thank you.

The goal is to have something with a managed risk that should long-term perform better than investing in real estate.

My clean energy portfolio is down 15% since my dumbass bought at all-time highs. I have TAN, FAN, ICLN, QCLN, PLUG, SPWR. I am wondering if I should sell some of these at a loss or just wait it out. I am in no rush (student).
My portfolio used to be fairly heavy tech and growth focused, but have been slowly adding more value stocks in the end of last year and looks now like this:

* VWRL ALL WORLD ETF  22.5%
* HAN-GINS CLOUD ETF  11.6%
* Prosus (Tencent)    6.5%
* Eurostoxx 50 ETF   6.5%

* Krane CSI Internet  ETF  3.4%
* Datadog     3.3%

What do you all think of the current portfolio?

***Backstory***: knew I had a lot of cash (200.000€) incoming from a renovation. Started researching and reading up in October. I have been really investing for a month (not trading, just averaging down), investing a bit every 3 days.

&#x200B;

**Lessons learned so far:** 

\- in November bought my tryout stock: 50€ FRA:Very good food co 0SI (vegan burgers etc) just after they entered the market. Pennystock so small pump and dump , plus large fees to buy on FRA, so lost a little bit. Didn't fall to intial levels, so I believe in the stock, will increase position and average down. 

\- *The stock of which we do not speak*:  learned to regulate emotions, hold, and get profit by buying and selling on the good moments. Will keep doing that for a bit + decrease position but keep it as a YOLO in my portfolio & a possible hedge in case of moon.

&#x200B;

**Current portfolio** is very spread, want to make my own ETF. I have the time to do this.

    EPA:Airbus	AIR	2,21% 
    Alibaba	        BABA	0,90% 
    Blackberry	BB	1,03% 
    Chipotle	CMG	1,93% 
    Discovery	DISCA	1,16% 
    Domino's	DPZ	8,98% 
    G***stop	GME	25,47% 
    LSE:Lukoil	LCOD	1,08% 
    EPA: LVMH	MC	1,80% 
    Mastercard	MA	1,50% 
    Mattel	        MAT	0,27% 
    Microsoft	MSFT	1,62% 
    Nike	        NKE	1,77% 
    NIO	        NIO	0,53%

    FRA:V.goodfoodco0SI	0,05% 
    Virgin	        SPCE	3,99% 
    Visa	        V	1,45% 
    Walt Disney	DIS	8,84%
    
    
    CASH     70% 

Cash is a lot but I worked hard for my money and don't want to lump sum invest. I am slowly buying during dips, and averaging down, I also waited to invest in green energy after last month's runup. Will increase positions in most except for TSLA, SHOP and G\*E. Will keep a permanent 30% cash aside for buying dips and rotating portfolio.

&#x200B;

This month's profit: 4.47% (bought every week so on average it is 2.5 weeks?)

Sold with profit: Sony, Apple, AMC, GME, might repurchase Sony. 

&#x200B;

**Stocks I am looking into purchasing too:**

    FRA:Nintendo    NTO 
    TPI composites	TPIC	wind 
    OMK:Vestas wind	VWS	wind 
    OMK:Orsted A/S	ORSTED	wind 
    Sunrun	        RUN	solar china 
    DAQO new energy	DAQO	solar residential 
    Quanta services	PWR	pipelines, transmission building 
    XET:Verbio	VBK	biofuel 
    XET:Volkswagen	VOW3 
    FRA:	Volvo	VOL1    believe in Polestar
    EAM:PostNL	PNL	EU parcel service 
    XET:Adidas	ADS	probably replace Nike with this 
    XET:Astrazeneca	ZEG	? 
    EBR:Ackermans & van haaren ACKB hedgefund 
    EAM:Boskalis    BOKA	dredging, wind, ports

  
I feel green energy is currently below value after the hype, so will purchase some before they get back to true value level. EU is building down fossil fuels so will probably only buy on the EU markets. Green energy is a very long, also looking into dredging companies etc for climate change hedging.   
Waiting to put money into construction should *the stock of which we do not speak* moon, and buy those dips. Also heavy in EU markets invested in case this makes the US market crash, EU will follow but I'll have time to get out without so much losses. Plus I want to diversify as much as possible.

  
Will put a lot of spare cash in AKCB, like the companies they invest in.  


Would also get on some crypto mining company but don't know a lot about it.  Aka *"during a gold rush, sell shovels"* 

&#x200B;

***Sidenote*****:** I don't look to much into numbers, because it can all be interpreted in many ways. (Is a company undervalued or are they just presenting themselves like this or are some HF profiting from making the company look that way in the news? )   
I only buy companies I know, mostly intuitively: is the public perception good (or brand loyalty) are they innovating or expanding, or will they be needed more in the future?

  
It's based on Warren Buffet's: "*I bought Dunkin Donuts because I liked their coffee."*  
Which might make me a complete idiot, so feel free to completely tear this all apart.

Started about 5 weeks ago and got burned a bit by the meme stocks. Came out ahead, I got into AMC and BB of my own accord after doing research about a week earlier but averaged up slightly when the hype rose, before the trading restrictions hit. Ended up with a gain of about 15% instead of 75%. I'm 20, haven't invested a ton of money, just trying to learn the ropes before I dive in deeper.

MSFT - 16.1%

NVDA - 12.8%

Current plan is to lower my position in BB, NOK and NVAX through this spring and then continue to hold the rest and continue to add to the index funds. Timeline is 30 ish years.

Any advice I’d appreciated!

I started investing last week (VERY NEW TO STOCKS). 

I have five stocks on my portfolio TSLA, QCLN, ICLN, ARKK, ARKG. Each stock is about 20% of my portfolio. 

I am in my fourties. What do you guys think about this portfolio???
Beginner, 30, this is my retirement fund. Going to hold on these stocks for a couple years (2-5), and reevaluate then. The ETFs are hold for 20-30 years.

* get back into $V or $MA sometime.  
  
Could I get some feedback? Especially on the stocks section, since I think that might be too tech-heavy.
I got started 1st of Feb with some GME and AMC shares which I've since sold. GME was +100% and AMC i sold at $50 total loss. In march was when I started looking at the market and look around a bit on what to buy.

This is the current portofolio composition which is a bit tech-heavy. Looking for some advice.

Hello Err I have a question I recently found out I hit the max amount of day trade and I accidently bought a stock I didn't want to buy because I though I was on the call options, so I tried to sell it, it says I can't sell a stock I bought the same day I bought it because of the retrictions.

Does this mean I would be able to sell the stock I'd bought today tomorrow? 

I need some help.... please..

Looking to stop putting money into ARK funds, instead going for QQQ, keeping the balance of 80/20 for safe mutual funds and tech etfs. I'm a bit lost about the balance of mutual funds, as there is alot of overlap- is there any benefit to this vs. just going all in on sp500? I like safe, but   this is a 30 year horizon

I know, 3/4 of my portfolio with TSLA is super risky and objectively wrong, but I can tolerate high risk and I don't have that much money to be able to diversify properly.
Is SMH safe as a long term hold?
I set 100% on Vestas wind systems (VWS) as a long term since I think it is a solid company and I wanted to contribute to renewable energies. However I already lost 13% and now I think it might be overvalued and that it will take a LONG time to come to the original price. Do you think I should take the loss and reinvest in something else? or just see it as a very Long term? I am a student, I just bought 10 shares.
This is a fantastic portfolio. Sofina is probably my favorite stock in Europe. 

I think there's some great opportunities in the Polish market too, I have 10% of portfolio in Polish domestic stocks.

QQQJ is a solid option for mid-cap exposure. I have recently been looking into arguments for small-mid-large cap growth and have been going in circles. Ultimately, the coronavirus only served to enrich large cap companies and leave small caps with debt. In the short term, my bet is on large cap (QQQ) and mid cap (QQQJ) on continued performance.
Looks solid to me
That’s what I do. I buy and sell regularly. My goal is a short term 5% profit per 1-3 weeks and then I sell and buy another low. The rest of my cash is in more long term , but right now I’m trying to turn this into a bigger  sum.

I can see myself going in the red. But I don’t have to sell, I can hold for a long time. I don’t spend money I need. 

Last time I invested for 3 months I easily made 20% profit every 90 days using this strategy. Started again recently and damn is the market going unfavorably
Just as a tip, Peter Lynch (former Magellan Hedge Fund manager, known for being one of the best) says to have more than five stocks because some are bound to disappoint you. He has some good books if you’re interested.
Actually not bad, however if you have a 3 stock portfolio it is very risky. I would diversify a tiny bit more to around 10 stocks, so that you are diversified in different industries.
AAPL is risky for the next 6 months IMO. Arguing with FB over privacy, new phones didn't change much, plus it appears to be overvalued...I am getting into gambling stocks like PENN or DKNG. More states will legalize,  which means more revenue and less for new customer acquisition
I think your 401k already has alot of VTI type stuff, so you might be better off investing more into your 401k pretax, than buying more Index funds after the gov already took a piece of your paycheck. I’d dump it and average down TSM or do some DD on another company you like.
Yes, and yes you do.
Yes
50% correction on some
Of those already
Collect your profits on JETS.
Sexy
Buy an index etf, you're stressing me out. VTI/VOO or similar, and make that your biggest holding. Right now your stocks are highly correlated and volatile, which is not an ideal mix.

Edit: On second thought this applies to most of these portfolios.
Wooo ZM 46%..are you sure?
Averaging down to then sell off makes no sense unless you expect the stock to go up. Why do you expect that? And don't let narrow framing bias make you forget about opportunity cost.
I like your idea on dumping zoom, also probably dump fiver. Fiver is overvalued. I would want less exposure to Tesla too.
Some really good picks.  If the percentage is percent of portfolio, I would personally lower the position in Disney.  I wouldn’t have any one stock greater then 5-10% of portfolio.  Other then that looks really good
This portfolio is incredibly risky, especially with how overvalued Tesla stock is. I would consider taking some of that money from Tesla and putting it in more blue chip tech stocks like AAPL, Microsoft and Google.
>GE 

Any GE stock is too much GE stock.
I would dump ICLN, but I have been bearish on it since december as long as it is not a large percentage of your portfolio it should be fine to hold. It might improve when they rebalance. I would not hold single chinese stocks since you already have etfs dealing with those for you.
You have some overlap between the ARKs and individual stocks, so make sure you like the weighting of those companies. You're also very tech growth heavy.
Keep this and forget
Wait a bit. It broke the support line so may go down a bit more
That’s a lot of DIS.
LIT is a good lithium battery ETF and currently looks a bit discounted
Are you looking at Beam at all? Price action is looking like it might take a tumble (could be a good option for CRISPR)
I would like to know this as well
Would say that is a quite reasonably portfolio. I would maybe replace one or two banks or technology stocks in favor of more industry diversification but other than that nice work!
Keep it, your portfolio is good
Why VTI and VOO?
With that portfolio you won't lose it all. I would collect any profits in paypal and move to a fintech etf ARKF or FINX something like that while they are still down. A lot of smaller fintech companies have a lot more room to grow.
I see it :D

So you've got a lot of good stocks and bad stocks for example OTC microcap stocks.  Microcap stocks aren't "cheap" or discount stocks, they're almost scams (looking at that 6.06% one you have).  You should dump all of them except for ADRs like NTDOY.

Also you just have a lot of stocks in general.  If a single stock is less than 2 or 2.5% of your portfolio, it's not worth it.

Focus on enough stocks you can follow, generally this is less than a handful.  Just think of all the earnings reports and news you need to stay on top of.

Also, owning a lot of stocks is a waste of effort when you can just buy an equivalent ETF that's making better picks and rebalancing.
Disney parks opening soon and Disney+ being a success = keep it!  
MSFT signed that big contract with the US government so I think it'll have a lot of profit in the mid and long term. Costco has had a lot of sideways movement so maybe I wouldn't keep it, but rather HomeDepot since people tend to be renovating for summer and etc. Spotify has been CHEAP, so I'm assuming you'll have some major gains there
Some solid picks IMO.
If you are aware of the risks that technolgy and richly valued stocks have than go for it
Very risky and focused on technology.
Very high growth, a lot of tech/software so that could possibly be diversified. But it looks pretty good.
why the heck do you have both VOO and SPY, they're literally the same thing
You have no mid or small cap exposure. I would consolidate your SPY and VOO into VTI so that you get small and mid cap exposure.
Bit tech heavy and spy/voo both track pretty much the same stocks, may want to diversify by adding a broader market index as well as international like schb/vtsax/schf.
I like the ROTH VTI approach
MAX THE ROTH

When you retire at 50 with $12 million tax free dollars in the bank you will thank you 18 year old self.
Congratulations on starting this early.  You will end up with 3-4x the gains of someone who started later.

The most important thing, given that time is your greatest asset, is just establishing good habits.  Wherever you put it, put amounts in regularly (dollar cost averaging) and continue to do so in red times.  You are essentially guaranteed to outlast any bear market you encounter.
Definitely max your Roth, as for investing I would establish a base portfolio that is well diversified with ETFs and then make a couple of riskier plays with a small percentage of your assets. Depends on your personal risk tolerance, ultimately good investors make sure the risk/reward ratio is maximized.
This is bold.
JetBlue is at similar level to pre-covid drop despite posting the first highly unprofitable (and expected) fiscal year in years. Do you think they will go much higher?

Apple is one of the greatest companies in the world to hold forever, a good stabilizer in your portfolio.

Draft Kings is set for unreal explosion in growth and is set well to capitalize on the sports gambling sector. You have to realize the valuation is pretty rich already, do you think they have a lot of growth? Is a lot of growth already priced in? Are many more states set to legalize soon?

Gamestop is a total gamble. Fundamentals do not exist. Could go higher, could go lower. A lot of people will rip me apart for saying that.

Plug is priced highly already. 20B and has little to no revenue. Plans all say “for 2024 we plan to...”, hydrogen sourced energy / hydrogen power / hydrogen renewables are VERY far away.

It is a very very risky portfolio.
Perfect
I always like the slow and steady approach, buy a little today and if it dips more keeping buying small amounts. 

Unfortunately I don’t listen to my own advice and I’ve gained such a large position by DCA’ing into baba I can no longer justify putting more money in. It’s about 10% of my portfolio at this point
[deleted]
pretty tech heavy, if your goal of holding 18 different stocks is to limit your risk keeping it all in one sector may not be the best way to do that

just my 2 cents
FORM has monopoly in some sectors of 5G
Not sure why you were downvoted, looks to be a pretty solid portfolio
I think you've had an excellent past two weeks. Throw in a market-following ETF there for assurance and I'd call it good
The better question is how have you made so much money without knowing about investing. You just missed out on 5 years of bull market!!
No GME?
Not a great idea, good luck
I would not hold AMC long term. They will survive when things open back up, but won't ever reach their previous ath.
Why are you bullish on FSR?
I'd look towards REITs, and I'd plan an exit strategy for the ark etf's. They've been hot for a while, and covid/tech stocks are gonna cool down. I also think comparing Cathie Green to Buffet is nonsense, and there's a reckoning coming for all of these tech stocks that don't have actual revenue/growth models to backup their pricing. My favorite example of this is TSLA. There's no secret Tesla is going to grow, but you need to contextualize their share price/market cap to a growth model. 

Diversifying to protect for inflation/recession doesn't mean you have to invest in precious metals. You can, there's nothing wrong with that, but there are plenty of other strategies like companies that produce and sell necessity goods and real estate. Whether you're investing in REIT's or physical property you're planning on renting. You can't go wrong with either during periods of inflation. 

I'd really encourage you to learn more about systematic risk and beta, because it will make you a much better investor. I'm all for taking more risk in your investments, but you should still diversify.
22? Buy shit your believe and want to own. All sorts of them out there you may like OWN. Be an owner of the company. 

Looks like you a lot of that. Maybe find just one good company that pays a dividend you like. HD or whatever. 

Good luck and keep funding!
Many of these are now either flat or up for you after today.
Way too tech heavy
I also like it. Don’t sell the ARKK and Q. Just stop looking at it for awhile. Personally I like ARKF and Q but either way they’re just full of great companies. You’ll get back to whole soon.
Don't sell low lol.   


Use upcoming paychecks to invest in different stuff.
I’ve been watching Texas Roadhouse for a while.Over valued rn but under 80ish I would start a position
What's up with rolls-Royce?
Overall, your portfolio looks solid but I'm personally not a big fan of an even allocation into DIS, TDOC and V if they are new purchases. If you bought these 9-12 months ago then I have no qualms (but I'd still consider taking profits on some). With the exception of TDOC they're all blue chips so it's hard to go wrong. They play a big role in major indexes and index funds so your portfolio will likely mirror the overall market trends.


My own hesitation in Disney is that a lot of the reopening is already built into the price so things need to go perfect to justify that price 12 months from now. Again, if that's an older purchase then you're golden. That said, I don't understand the valuation of visa (and mastercard). Both with ridiculously high P/E for companies that aren't growth stocks. They aren't bad companies, but if I'm going to pay for a P/E 45-50 why wouldn't I have taken Google at 30 or a faster growing semiconductor stock. V attempts to balance your portfolio, and again it's by no means a bad company or stock. But you're committing to the long haul and potentially ignoring other stocks that will grow wealth more expeditiously.
Only you can really estimate how you see the future growths and downturns. Market is clearly optimistic.

The way I see it, if you sell now and buy ETFs, and the market goes up, you benefit anyway. If it goes down, the ETFs are probably safer investment than your current holdings.
I think J is a natural pairing with M bad has good synergy. Been tough lately but I like how you weight M more. Hold through, those mid cap stocks hit growth rates higher than M and ultimately become an M
Can’t go wrong w any of your choices.

I would look at AAPL MSFT GOOG and then AMZN. Just my order. I like them all.
Love to see the PLTR. 

Everyone always hating. 

They’re expecting 30% growth this year. 

They made profit last year.  

Shortsighted people don’t get the long game lol.
I can recommend EQQU and VUSD if you ever relocate your assets, e.g. want to sell some VUSD to buy another stock on a dip. That way you don't need to change currency.
If you're betting on us legalization msos is a good one to own. It's an etf of us cannabis companies
I would avoid lucid motors and any other ev stocks until there is a clear path to profitability. NIO for example is already making and selling a lot of cars.
Why spy if you have a good amount of it in specific stocks (already included)?
Hopefully that facebook leak doesnt affect us
Yours is the strongest I’ve seen in this thread. Only one question mark. Why GE ?
Looks like you'll do really well in all sorts of climates. Nice.
Don't really like it tbh too much overbought/overvalued tech
Good luck when when we hit a massive correction.
Taiwan semiconductor is your best stock here .. intel might eventually start hiring them to make their chips and they will explode even more.. so far they are majority providers of 5nm chips .. intel is so far from the technology it’s not even funny
You obviously believe in e-commerce here—I’d look into EBAY and LEAF.
Congrats from swapping over from gambling to investing.  Some good picks there
Nice, I think I need to look into V
Can you explain the reason for GE?
Your holdings seem to be concentrated to newer technologies and have big correlations in price. If that is your goal that is ok, but if you want solid returns over several years, I would personally diversify a bit.
Q2 hopefully
IMHO solid and safe strategy. Insurance companies are generally a decent pick, because they simply raise premiums if needed or skip the dividend payout.

Financial institutions: Well, since 2008 I simply don't like them anymore. If it weren't for that, probably solid but personally I would reduce the weight. 

PS: If you haven't heard, lookup CS, they're probably quite cheap right now ;P
Good luck on BB, I finally cut the bag last week.
Icln is a turd now due to plug dumped it with a 10 percent gain for qqqm much happier
A lot of those are very risky. I would add some broad market exposure.
Looks pretty solid.
You already get tesla exposure through arkk. I would replace it with a broad market etf. I would replace amd with a semiconductor etf a lot of the other chip producers will get better growth over the next couple years. Many countries now want home grown chips.
I would replace voo with vti just so you have more coverage. Small cap us stocks are doing really well right now. If the european stock market go s down a lot load up on VXUS.
I bet this is going to do well over the next year. Nice job at picking without getting a bunch of risky hyper growth stocks.
So basically ARKF,G, Q and x ?
I think there’s a lot better ones out there and a lot safer. USO I believe has found it’s bottom and should end up in the 51 to 55 range within the next 3 months. Should be good for a nice 20 to 30%. I also like TGT, QCOM, and MSFT.
Cathie is that you?
BFLY: Healthcare is imho high risk high reward most of the time: No income, lots of debt. There's no financial data prior to 2020 (at least on yahoo). They made -162 mio pretax income. But their product looks really nice and interesting.

Their latest financial report is 185 pages long, study it thoroughly before you buy. 6% seems fine. They also have competition. Check them, too, maybe they have a superior product for a better price.

&#x200B;

BYND: I have to taste it before I'd even check further ;D. Does it taste good?

&#x200B;

CGX.TO: -708 million pretax income in 2020 (48, 97, 97 in 2019, 18 and 17). Total assets: 2.333 billion, total liabilities: 2.309 billion. 1.896 billion total debt. Going big maybe considering share price, but imho not in company value. 

I'd check the competition, how the market has evolved in the last years. Where I'm from, the amount of cinema goers nearly halved since 1980, while the population has grown around 25%. Maybe this will change, but I doubt it.

&#x200B;

Graphene: Needs thorough research. The material is very exciting. The technology is still in the beginning. It's imho a long term gamble. A company needs to make money. That's why I would probably wait, until I'm sure, that they will make money in 2, 3 years and won't go bankrupt. Manchester university does have a graphene research facility and they state, that over 100 companies are partnering with them. And if I scan through the properties of the wiki page... yeah, that's a lot of potential, tech and money.

&#x200B;

ETFs: There's so many out there... Clean Tech seems like a good idea for the future...

&#x200B;

Other thoughts:

* Since you're canadian, exchange rates could be a real pain... CHF compared to USD had yearly spikes in both directions of 15%. For that reason I only bought companies listed in Switzerland. I just didn't want to have to think about exchange rates, too.
* Also check what the dividends are. There's also ETFs that pay dividends, e.g. CHDVD paid 3.5% the last 12 months. And when you look at their main holdings, like Nestlé, Zurich Insurance, Novartis and Roche, they always (sic!) paid a dividend in the last 20 years, and almost always more than the previous year. So when the markets are going down, even though the value of your stocks are going down, you will have an income, which you can either invest again or use otherwise.
Not bad picks but I prefer active or passive. For me VUG > VTI (total stock market) and the long-term performance speaks for itself.
two years is a short time. buy and hold for ten years. also maybe trade out some of the high risk stuff for more solid companies with solid balance sheets and good management
I'm excited for Coursera personally. Yea its still 'education tech', but its got good legs and I think it will be seen as a very attractive and accessible alternative to traditional colleges.
i always love having a consumer staples play, right now i have walmart.growth potential isn’t as great as tech but it’s a good defensive play to diversify without being as conservative as utilities (which i also like to have a little of)
what do you think about XOMs future?
You are overlapping. I’d use VOO or the single stocks
SCHD is a great stock. Im about to sell my casinos and put 4000 in it.

it grows and pays a decent dividend.
1. For your backbone etf I would either do all VTI or do VOO with an IJR or Vanguards small cap index at a ratio you like 
2. You are very overweight AAPL, alphavet and MSFT. The #1 and 2 holdings in VOO are Apple at 5 or 6 % and then MSFT at 5 or 6%. Google is up there as well. If you are going to pick stocks, consider only owning 5 or so % maybe 10% if one of the picks does really well. 
 
Unsolicited advice - probably safest to be closer to all ETF if you are just starting. If you want more risk, you can get it with sector or narrow growth ETFs. For example, you mentioned airlines - maybe go with the aerospace/defense ETF and get exposure to the industry. If you love Tesla, maybe go with ARKK. I started with 10% stocks 90%ETFs at first.

Additionally, would consider adding some international exposure.
ARKX is insane to get at 0.75% expense ratio. Nowhere near as innovative as ARKK or ARKF or even ARKG which is a bit higher risk higher reward.
You have a lot of overlap between ARK funds and the stocks you own. I imagine your good days are really good and your bad very bad. I’d say a bit too weighted to certain sectors and “overpriced” stocks.
Plz don’t lol. Buy Visa/MasterCard or something like that too balance your portfolio. AMC is almost guaranteed to blow up in your face. Lots of better opportunities.
So many unnecessary fees for so much overlap
Nio and amc are garbage.  But go ahead by all means
That’s pretty nice my dude!! I’m starting off slow myself. Got a few in Apple. And I just bought some sundial growth shares.
A lot of focus on clean energy and EV, I would definitely consolidate some of these. Choose 2 or 3 you like the most and diversify the rest in other areas.
Sell gme if you made a profit and put half of your gains in something safer. The other half pick another stock that is risky.
Love to see MSFT, PFE, HON, and AVGO here. At current levels, I might take *some* profits on CAT and sell out of MMM, but other than that, I like your portfolio and the diversification.
ICLN is doing some moving around of its holdings soon, seen articles saying it’s expanding quite a lot instead of being beholden to fucking plug
your greatest advantage is you are young (i assume) bc you are a student.

when i was a student in 2013 i got tesla then sold it when it tripled. just buy and hold.... OOPS.

something will blow up

conpound interest is your friend. your greatest asset is TIME
Why would you buy PLUG AND ICLN knowing that ICLN's biggest holding is PLUG?
like it, good move rotating out of tech into value months before the full rotation happened. id say i’d be looking to add some more large cap tech if you are looking to buy and hold for a long time.valuations on a lot of big cap tech are still very reasonable
Not diversified in terms of industries. What is your long term goal and when do you need the money
Not screwed at all. I’m holding calls for both of those. So if ur screwed then I’m screwed too.
I'm in for 30 shares of apple at 128 I'm bullish and I'm with the company for the long run.
Both are green?
Have you looked into VT?
I would sell Tesla right now.
All the others seem great long term holdings for me
Interesting mix of growth and value stocks. What is your reasoning for IRBO vs something like ARKQ or BOTZ?
Baba could be facing some headwinds you should check out EWEB just for exposure to the rest of the Chinese e-commerce stocks.
why haven’t you bought etfs instead
I have a shredder you can borrow if you’re gonna keep buying Ford
Nio is currently oversold I would dump GME for NIO. Love the AMD play
Your portfolio is 45% in two EVs. You feel good about that?
Oil ewww
QQQ is back ark is not
^(Disclaimer: Don't listen to me ;-))

&#x200B;

> *The stock of which we do not speak*:  learned to regulate emotions, hold, and get profit by buying and selling on the good moments. 

There's a line between trading and investing....

&#x200B;

I thought Peter Lynch liked Dunkin Donuts' coffee :P - Warren Buffet probably too, but I think Peter Lynch said that.

And since we're quoting Warren: "Diversification is a protection against ignorance it makes very little sense for those who know what they're doing."

You have 23 positions... and want to add another 15. That's 38 positions. Check for instance [CHDVD ETF](https://www.ishares.com/ch/individual/en/products/264108/ishares-swiss-dividend-ch-fund). They have 34 positions. 3.5% dividend payout the last 12 months, 0.15% management fee. They went up 45% the last 7 years (from 100 to 140 before corona, to 104, now at 146).  They rebalance *four times a year*. Are you confident enough to outperform a decent ETF with the amount of time you're investing? Or are you better off financially if you were to invest your money into an ETF and work and invest your earnings into an ETF?

And ask yourself: What are you going to do, when the markets are going down long term? Like in 2000 or 2008, only to name the really bad years with years of recovery. And they *will* go down again. Because it's very easy to invest money when everything is going up, all the indicators are green. Do you think you can react fast enough to determine which positions are resilient, which one will have a hard time to come back again, which one will be close to bankruptcy? 

&#x200B;

>This month's profit: 4.47% (bought every week so on average it is 2.5 weeks?) 

Well, most of the markets went up. Investing is long term, and not only about how much more you make when the markets go up, but also about how much less you lose, when the markets go down. Come again and share how much you gained one year after the next crash ;-)

&#x200B;

> I don't look to much into numbers, because it can all be interpreted in  many ways. (Is a company undervalued or are they just presenting  themselves like this or are some HF profiting from making the company  look that way in the news? )  
I only buy companies I know, mostly  intuitively: is the public perception good (or brand loyalty) are they  innovating or expanding, or will they be needed more in the future? 

Long term, the stock price usually represents the value of a company and the prospect of return. So you have to figure out if a stock price is expensive or cheap. Think about it like this: If you were to buy the whole company, would it be worth the price? Can you sell it in 10 years for 150-200%? One of my stocks which is a very robust and boring still had a high of 260 and low of 208 in 2018. If you think the stock is worth 300, then it doesn't matter much, but if you think the stock's value is more like 200, you probably shouldn't buy at 260. 

Numbers: I mostly check how the incoming and spending is and how they developed in the past. And how much debt they have, compared to their assets and cash, and how that developed. It's also great to compare competitors. Black Berry for instance: Net income 2019: -152 millions. 2020: -1'104 millions. Net debt from 229 millions to 506 millions. They are reinventing themselves, yes. They have lots of good customers and partnerships, like aws, microsoft, intel, google. But they probably won't make any profit the next 3 years. That's why I personally would put them on a watchlist and check again when the next report is published.
Buy Arkw then matches your holdings
lol
Lock in any gains on amc and replace it with something else.
Sell american airlines now if you have gains the are really over valued and there financials are not good. If gas prices rise they will be in trouble. At least set a stop loss on it.

I would definitely put the rest of your cash in VTI or VOO.
Looks really solid. That is a lot of extra cash though. If things start going down again you should consider DCA in some of it.
SOXL caught my mind, I too have \~10% in SOXL and am really excited to see where it goes as semiconductor demand is crazy and supply chain on semiconductors is a big issue
A lot of ARK exposure here
I wouldn't hold GME in a Roth.
You must have gotten shredded a few weeks ago during the NASDAQ selloff, lol.

I think if you're looking for a shorter timeframe hold, then it looks pretty good to me.

The exception might be ICLN.  I feel like that's a much longer play than 2 years.

The 25% you're being risky with might be better off in a total market index fund (something that tracks the S&P 500, for example).
Tesla might be trading sideways or trending down slowly for a long time. There are better places to put money.
For some nice ETFs take a look at SMH & QQQJ. These should help you diversify a bit.

Arkg is solid. A lot of people on Reddit are bearish on Arkk and so am I, I would consider reducing it to 5-10% or swapping for Arkf.

Pretty risky to put 40% into clean energy given that a lot of the hype around clean energy is already priced in.

Obviously TSLA is high risk, high reward. If you want to reduce risk but still have a solid chance at high reward, consider APPL & MSFT. They aren’t going anywhere and have consistently outperformed the market for a long time.

Overall I think you could reduce your risk pretty significantly without giving up too much potential with some of these changes, but definitely do your own research.
Looks like you just started and bought into all the internet hype. If I were you I’d build up a good base of stable long term hold ETFs like VTI or VOO as 80% of your portfolio, then use the other 20% to invest in the funds/stocks you’ve listed here
This is a very risky portfolio. Remember that a good company does not necessarily equal a good stock. Most of these have had tremendous runs recently, and are unlikely to grow at the same rate in the short term. What is your ultimate investment goal and time frame?
You have a solid LT portfolio. ADBE is a good one. Keep it up!
I really think amd is over valued. All the world countries want home grown and manufactured chips right now. This is bad news for the large incumbents. If you are not totally against you should consider a semi conductor etf.
If youre in this for the long run, the best time to buy any FAANG is always right now
It might be relevant to consider how long the individual can let their portfolio sit and grow; a 60-year-old with a somewhat risky portfolio is completely different from a 25-year-old with the same portfolio, as I am led to believe you want to start lowering risk the closer you are to retirement, but it is OK to have a bit of risk in growth stocks when you are young as you have plenty of time to wait out the market fluctuations. 

The specific ages (21 vs 26, for example) don't matter, but the general range kind of does.
Because it tells people your probable time horizon for investing, and whether you should be taking more or less risk.
yeah you should.sounds like it’s pattern day trading restriction, completely goes away next market day
Bet on the world's largest producer of lithium, Albemarle - symbol ALB - instead of picking individual EV makers, esp. since TSLA continues to be the emperor with no clothes (no real profits)...

Glad you are balancing meme stocks with the index funds, but if you are going long term, how about some more solid companies with good balance sheets and including more diversity in your portfolio.

Where is your healthcare/pharma for example, like PFE or SNY ? Also, GILD continues to be a bargain. When their R&D finally hits on the next big drug, the stock will skyrocket. They have a ton of cash in hand.

Like ALB in the EV space, we can look at RTX as a  "picks and shovels" stock instead of picking SAVE or BA for a resurgent airline industry.

Other suggestions: PFE, FDX, DIS, JCI, BRK/B, JW/A, WY, DEO

Drop cron weed stocks are a bull trap. They might go back up eventually then crash down again. If you are determined to hold it set a stoploss.
Up every day for 3 days? You must be an investing genius.
While it's not a bad idea being in ARKX, it's a bad idea being 100% into any ticker.
Yeah you're good semis as a whole ain't going anywhere
Compared to most ETFs no but it’s growth potential is a lot higher
Please be careful doing trading like that, you will end up paying for someone else's profit.

The market's ups and downs are not a good consultant, and they are certainly not enough to judge what is overvalued and what is not. Did something change in your initial evaluation of the company? Did you do any actual evaluation of the company?

What is your investment horizon? Will you need the money back soon? What are your goals?

Start reading a bit and do not rush into buying just because you want to "invest" in something.
I would personally invest in something else. There are a lot of great deals out there with the tech correction that happened and things opening back up in the next six months. Depending on where you live you can write off the loss on your taxes also.
Thanks! I really like Sofina too, can't wait for their annual report.

I just recently bought Mo-BRUK but I also know of CD Projekt and Allegro, any other stocks you recommend to take a look at in Poland?
Thanks! Covid-19 test will be needed for a long time to come, even with a lot of the population vaccinated. I also doubt that the EU will have vaccinated half its adult population even within a year and at the same time we can see that the spread of the virus is not stopping. Covid-19 test will for that reason still be needed for some time and Novacyt will continue to have this revenue stream

That being said I'm not that well researched on the valuation of Novacyt or how to even calculate it due to the uncertainties of the virus. It's one of my smaller plays and as you can see one of my worst performing ones. 

Do you have any thoughts to share?
thanks, il look his books up!
Late post but I sold my Long term Delta shares today. May for the rest once 1 year kicks in. I dont trust airlines.
There's definitely alot of work I need to do. I'll start looking into ETFs
I jumped way too late on Zoom
Yup looking to taper that percent down with new picks/rotation, thanks.
I'm young with a very high risk tolerance. I've done a very deep dive on Tesla and I consider to be the least risky out of my current holdings. However, if Tesla drops 50%, I'm absolutely fine with that and will buy a lot more. Do I believe theres a decent chance of it dropping 50%? No way. Right now it's technically overvalued as in its valued higher than its intrinsic value, but its earnings are going to grow at an astonishing rate over the next decade, far outpacing Apple, Microsoft or Google. So it makes these prices look very attractive from a 10 year perspective.
Thanks mate, swapped it for MCD, hoping that’s better.
what sector should I diversify into?
Agreed. Once it rebounds a bit I plan to move some of that Disney somewhere else
I was looking at BEAM! (or Editas). What do you feel would be a good price target to get in at?
Personally think MSFT, AMD, DIS and APPL are all solid picks. These companies arn't going anywhere anytime soon and are market leaders poised to grow.

ESPO has a nice bunch of holdings in various online gaming related things, which is another industry I think will grow.

VOOG for the S&P 500 tracking and the rest are speculative stocks in the crypto space that I'm hoping will grow significantly in the next 10 years.

Even if they don't, I don't want to think like --- ahh damn it, if ONLY i'd invested in em. So willing to take the hit on them, so as long as the gains from the others makes up for it.
Thanks! I'm more bullish on Indian banks at the moment, as a developing country needs banks to grow. Will shift this focus to tech companies over time.
Am I too overfocused on tech, or will it be an acceptable risk since I have a long time before retirement? Thanks for the response.
Yeah good question... I guess I want to put more weight on the top 500 of VTI. But yeah arguably it makes little difference
Thanks for the feedback!
I own VREOF because I'm a customer of theirs and believe in their product.
Which of the others are OTCs that you think I should dump?
really happy I got in when I did because it was before the MSFT and DIS news. Costco was kind of an off one, I knew so many people that regularly go. I'll keep an eye on Home Depot, and Spotify announced a foray into live audio, so big gains hopefully. Thank you!
Well, it's the future. And I actually believe most of my holdings are undervalued.
Yep true but I feel it’s worth it long term. Thinking of adding Berkshire and Abbott to balance it out. Great companies
[deleted]
What about the possibility of me not staying in this career field? I like what I am doing at the moment but then again, I'm also 18 things could always change.
Thanks for your input that make sense to divide into different sectors, started last year investing in stocks, and found this is where growth is.
Gut feeling. Mostly holding until their 2022 EV release
Excellent response. Thank you
Vanguard, Microsoft and apple are all up today, thankfully
MSFT is near ATH. AAPL is overpriced compared to historical valuation. I’d say now is a great time to rebalance.
the balance sheets do not look good.... the brand name has lots of shine tho!

if you want airplane parts, pick RTX imho
Also add FB and NFLX. Cant go wrong with FAANG
Ok I’ll check them out. Thanks
Intel might be a smart turnaround story haven't looked enough for when to enter but I'd definitely consider it
Potential in aviation and overall improvement of the company in regards to its pensions, balance sheets. Better management basically! I am looking to get the total portfolio % down as I have been averaging it down on red days.
You're absolutely right, my portfolio goes up and down depending how the market feels about the electric vehicle and clean energy industries. Been very rewarding this last year and I hope it keeps the momentum but I'll be honest, these are the only stocks I feel comfortable holding long term and that's why I have them. 

These stocks could trade flat for years or boom every year, and that's a risk I'm willing to take.
Yeah I kind of want to do the same but at the same time it's such a small percentage of my portfolio I don't mind seeing what happens in the next year or so.
Im pretty new to stocks, but I bought XOM at 39 a few months ago and its moved with the price of oil. They pay a nice dividend and atm I dont see a huge transition away from gasoline like some may predict... at least in the next 10 years or so. Definitely in the next couple of decades we will move away from fossil fuels but as of right now XOM should have some good earnings in the next couple of quarters. They will have to transition their business model into different forms of renewable energy at some point though
Yeah, I’ve been thinking that. I’m waiting till it’s in the green and then I’m fixing that. I bought those starting out. I just started investing in 2021. So I’m still figuring out things. Thanks for the tip super helpful.
To be honest, at this point, it is getting hard to justify not taking a lot of profits and minimizing the stock diversification. Between FOMO and trying to juggle taxes, I am doing small moves though...
Aka selling their stuff that is way down to buy the other stuff in it.

Great strategy building in a sell low buy high.
Thank you for your advice!
yeah good call. Might add some AAPL when the next correction hits
I have most of my money in SWPPX as a sort of safe retirement setup. Very long term with scheduled deposits. 

This additional here stuff is 4-5 year, 10 year max depending on market obviously.  

However I'm not good with diversity like you say, what other industries would you suggest I look into?
Yup. Got 1,000 pltr at 21.90. Will double down if it drops below 20
But for how long...
Ya I don't think it tastes good.

>There's a line between trading and investing....

More of a smudge, really.
>I thought Peter Lynch liked Dunkin Donuts' coffee :P - Warren Buffet probably too, but I think Peter Lynch said that.

Ha you might be right!! :) As I said, I'm an idiot.

Also thanks for the tip on CHDVD, I was looking at ETF's but never considered this. Vanguard just doesn't do it for me.  I do like to have a bit of 'control' so I want to keep single stocks too. I have the time for it.  


And yes, the profit was indeed bc the markets went up and I luckily escaped the tech selloff :p

> Come again and share how much you gained one year after the next crash ;-) 

That's why I want to diversify as much as possible, but guess I'll just gain some very expensive wisdom from it haha

&#x200B;

Also thanks for this detailed review and taking your time to go through it all! !

I will follow and sell BB for now. From my original positions I do want cut some and exchange some too for some of the 15. And as you suggested I will include CHDVD as a large chunk, thanks again for this tip!
All time highs today lol
I'm already out as of this morning. Swung it and got a nice net of $700. Transitioned the play to AMC and swing traded that for $300 so far...same deal, when the waves calm I will walk away
Thankyou so much! Awesome advice
I agree. There is way too much risk here for his age. And like someone else said a lot of the clean energy is priced in because of all the surrounding hype.

Don't just pick stocks based on internet hype, do your own DD into the actual underlying fundamentals, the balance sheets, ratios, etc.
Good shout on alb
Not a genius, I'm only up 350% in 3 months
I'm invested in Livechat, Asseco, Ambra, Delko and Neuca, especially the last one is interesting. Prices seem to be inflated a bit right now but the whole CEE region is booming and often overlooked. The only risks I see are currency related and some of the limited moat these companies have in the end. 

I'm not very optimistic with Allegro especially now that Amazon is knocking on the door in Poland.
Yeah Novacyt is a tough cookie at the moment, whereas it was a absolute no-brainer a couple of months ago. Earnings were good, outlook a bit vague. It makes sense though with all the uncertainties regarding the amount of testing needed in the future, the evolution of the virus and what the company can deliver in a post-covid world. Sentiment has been pretty bearish after earnings, but I'm still confident it will bounce back in the upcoming months. Hard to tell what a 'fair' valuation would be indeed. An acquisition by a bigger company is the dream obviously, but I doubt it will happen anytime soon.
I am absolutely bullish on Tesla. Will be one of the highest MC companies in the world when you look at 2030 (I believe), but I think you’re being blind a little bit. 

When you say earnings are set to grow at an astonishing rate over the next decade you are totally right, but does that mean the stock will follow? Lots is priced into Tesla right now. Tesla is a 650B market cap already so if it 2x then it’s worth 1.3T. Google is a 1.5T MC company and Microsoft is a 1.8T MC company. If you’re up there with the big boys your fundamentals need to catch up and I’m afraid if Tesla 2x or 3x from here their fundamentals would be even more astronomically overvalued than they already are. 

Also, there’s nothing wrong with saying Tesla > Apple or Microsoft in your portfolio. But what is wrong (in my opinion) is being 75% into one company. Highly risky (again, in my opinion), and I truly hope it works out for you. Again, I am bullish on Tesla but I think fundamentally being 75% in one company is foolish. Good luck.
I love your enthusiasm for growth; I’m a 24 y.o. whose also looking to have a very high risk portfolio. AAPL and MSFT don’t sound like growth, but they truly are. I would really hope you listen and pick some up
Should be.

GE has a ton of debt and liabilities - and some of them (related to LTC insurance) are probably not valued appropriately,  They also don't have much good parts left of their business.

GE's downfall is because of Jack Welch, and his tendency to cook the books, and take on high amounts of financial/insurance risk.  He's not the "brilliant leader" people made him out to be.
Assuming by your portfolio you want to play stuff that has high growth prospects, I'd say Weed (MSO) and Steel. My picks are Cresco and CLF.
Sorry I think I didn't expressed myself properly. Since you already have a few tech companies and bank companies it would be better to invest in other industries like consumer defensive, industrial  etc.
Invest in what you know. If you know tech, you know tech. I just posted mine for critique but a decent chunk of our portfolio is in trucking, gas, and related things. For example we had a short term position on a steel company.  Husband is management at TA and been in diesel repair sector for 15 years so that's where we are most likely to hear the rumors
I mean you are definitely leaning tech obviously but with 50% of your portfolio in VTI or VXUS that’s good enough diversification that you can do what you want with the other 50%. If you think tech will keep growing, which I agree with, then keep as is.
I I don't agree with you. but good luck.
Sounds like a good plan to me, I forgot you left ETF's out as well. So you do have more diversification then I originally thought.
The account is yours, you keep it if/when you leave.
With these holdings you have to bear in mind that there is the possibility of them declining around 90%. If you are ok with it, then fine. However I would suggest that taking Peter Lynches approach at at least have one stock in at least 4 baskets:

  

* Slow Growers: Large and aging companies expected to grow only slightly faster than the     U.S. economy as a whole, but often paying large regular dividends.
* Stalwarts: Large companies that are still able to grow, with annual earnings growth     rates of around 10% to 12%; examples include Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, and     Bristol-Myers. If purchased at a good price, Lynch says he expects good but not enormous     returns--certainly no more than 50% in two years and possibly less. Lynch suggests     rotating among the companies, selling when moderate gains are reached, and repeating the     process with others that haven’t yet appreciated. These firms also offer downside     protection during recessions. 
* Fast-Growers: Small, aggressive new firms with annual earnings growth of 20% to 25% a     year. These do not have to be in fast-growing industries, and in fact Lynch prefers those     that are not. Fast-growers are among Lynch’s favorites, and he says that an     investor’s biggest gains will come from this type of stock. However, they also carry     considerable risk. 
* Cyclicals: Companies in which sales and profits tend to rise and fall in somewhat     predictable patterns based on the economic cycle; examples include companies in the auto     industry, airlines and steel. Lynch warns that these firms can be mistaken for stalwarts     by inexperienced investors, but share prices of cyclicals can drop dramatically during     hard times. Thus, timing is crucial when investing in these firms, and Lynch says that     investors must learn to detect the early signs that business is starting to turn down. 
* Turnarounds: Companies that have been battered down or depressed--Lynch calls these "no-growers";     his examples include Chrysler, Penn Central and General Public Utilities (owner of Three     Mile Island). The stocks of successful turnarounds can move back up quickly, and Lynch     points out that of all the categories, these upturns are least related to the general     market.
* Asset opportunities: Companies that have assets that Wall Street analysts and others     have overlooked. Lynch points to several general areas where asset plays can often be     found--metals and oil, newspapers and TV stations, and patented drugs. However, finding     these hidden assets requires a real working knowledge of the company that owns the assets,     and Lynch points out that within this category, the "local" edge--your own     knowledge and experience--can be used to greatest advantage.
It's never bad to take profits. Expecially if you need to use them.
that’s the motto i live by
Industrials, Consumer Defensive, Financials...

Here is a pointer: 

[https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/03/072303.asp)
The CHDVD ETF is traded in CHF, not in US$! If you invest in another currency, you have to be even more careful. You have to consider inflation, exchange rates, political stability, and so on (that's why only invest in Swiss companies). Now is probably a good time, because inflation rates in Switzerland are predicted to be much lower in the US. The ETF could be up 5%, but because of the exchange rate, you're actually down 5%. If you want to sell it, do you sell it now, or do you think that the exchange rate will be better in half a year? There's plenty of ETFs that focus companies that pay dividend that are traded in US$, the CHDVD was simply the *only one I know decently well!*

&#x200B;

And don't sell BB (or buy CHDVD) just because someone on the internet said so. It's a transaction between two people: You have reasons to buy a company. The seller has reasons to sell a company. I basically picked BB as example because it has been controversial and I wanted to check their financial sheets. And if I were an owner of the company, I would sell it because I think in my opinion, their finances look bad, and I think they won't make a profit the next years. The reasons someone else buys the stock could be, that they think in 5-10 years, they will be at 30-50$ a share and trust them to get the job done. Or they think in short term, the stock will be at 12$ and make 50% within a year, because it has been very volatile. Both valid reasons to buy the stock. But not for me personally. I don't have the same reasons as you to buy or sell a stock. 

&#x200B;

Just keep in mind: You're buying a company. There's people, leaders, products, competition. A company has a past and a future. They have income and spendings, assets and liabilities. And if you want to go further: They can have long histories and a culture. My favorite share/company in my portfolio will be 125 years old this year. Went through the ups and downs, depressions and recessions, epidemics, pandemics, two world wars, they have seen it all. And the founding family still owns 51% of the bearer shares and they make sure, that "the leaders keep their feet on the ground". I obviously cared about the financial gain, but I also "like the stock".
That’s yolo yo
Thanks, I'll take a look!
Wow, Livechat's margins are absolutely ridiculous. Comes with a high price but 100% ROE, amongst other metrics, is insane...
Oh right, that way! Well yes, technology and financial stocks make up 73% of my portfolio. The rest is consumer durables (17%), energy (5%), automobile (3%), and FMCG (2%).

Since EV industry is growing, I'll be focusing more on stocks like TSLA and VOW3 from hereon.
Thanks, you too!
Thanks a lot. That's saying 20-30 picks so I've got a lot more work to do.
> The CHDVD ETF is traded in CHF, not in US$! 

Yes, I am a EU citizen and purchase in EUR, so USD is also conversion :) and now free gainz  


A lot of people were saying BB and NOK were a long run (i know, strangers on the internet :) ), but your comment kinda made me think about it again: why buy now if it could flatline the coming 3 years? There are some other favourites who I have high expectiations for like The Very Good Food Co, so it would make sense to trade them in for eachother.  


Again, good tips and I need to switch it up a bit too so that I like more of my stock too :)

But I can't help but feel the rush to ATH Is being fuelled by similar sentiment. Gonna take a step back and watch this shit rip another 200% probably, but I fear the rug pull more.
is COIN fucking up the nasdaq right now?
When is Disney going to resume dividends? When the parks open back up?
Ok can COIN get going already and show everyone in retail they can’t afford it so tech can come back please
J. Powell: "Most members of the committee don't see raising interest rates until 2024."
powell doesn't ride his bike on busy streets. bullish.
It's fascinating how the market literally started selling off exactly one hour before J. Powell's speech and then, again, at the exact moment it started.

It's not based on anything he says. The market just sells off in anticipation before he talks.
JPow have you been playing a lot of golf lately?

What about riding your bike?

WTF are these questions lmao
Coinbase already indicated at $340 I think.

Uhhh, it really wouldn't surprise me if we see what was seen when DoorDash made its debut to an extent. It was so big that it caused managers to sell other stocks and you saw things get dumped.
What do you guys think about Nintendo? I just bought some and I’m considering adding more. Good financials, loyal and passionate fanbase, reasonably priced stock.
Roku has gone from 292 to 393 in less than three weeks. Roku's basically already told us they're going to beat earnings too, despite continuing to pay for expansion, although Q1 is usually their weakest quarter.
JPMs earnings looking good. 5 billion in loan reserves discharged
JPM earnings put them at about 10 pe this year if they keep up with this profit every quarter, also their investment portfolio is growing fast enough that just relying on that is enough to keep them in business even if banking got disrupted.
I’m estimating coinbase opens around $450
Finally in the green since investing end of January...feel good.
If you weren’t gobbling up bank stocks and options after the earnings from JP and Goldman this morning what are you even doing?
Red day for no reason, cute.
I messed up bad and bought $1360 dollars worth of CNBS instead of COIN fml.
Yeah, what looked like it was going to be a tech led day turned into cyclicals at least for now.

Until these kinds of rotations consistently break, with it not being everything rallying together, it's going to be more of the same. Doesn't mean that pullbacks are impossible, but they will remain light.

The only thing that's maybe interesting is that the VIX is up.
AAPL is looking like the beginnings of a great cup and handle
Got tf outta plug. Coinbase here we come
Lol Bernie madoff kicked the bucket
Is now a good time to buy AAPL stock?
Oil is back! Time to buy up some dinosaur juice.
TSLA giveth and TSLA taketh away.

More importantly though my airliner stock is going back up again. Fingers crossed it keeps going.
Really hoping PLTR's demo rubber bands the price up to 28-30
Is VOO going to get a pullback to the 360s? I feel weird dropping money in at ATH.
[Story of my life](https://i.imgur.com/KGvu6ul.jpg)
My broker, Degiro, is now listing COIN at $500. Hard pass for me, then.
So glad to know powell can ride a bike that basically confirms the nasdaq breakout to 15k. I saw a bike pattern emerging 2 days ago.
Lots of green today
How would you go about investing $2k if you're planning to not look at it for the next 10 years?
Probably shouldn’t have sold my SQ at 270 yesterday
Sitting back and watching today.
All morning my UK stocks gradually go up. Then the moment we hit 2:30 pm the US market opens and that little green line goes into a nosedive.
COIN now estimated at 350.05. Second time I’ve had to update my limit order. Wish it would open already.
Is it better to buy Coinbase early/now, or after it’s opened?
alright, tell me who is buying how much COINBASE today ?
Preferred bank stocks for a Roth?
coin going to be at $600 at open at this rate
JPM, WFC and GS apparently beat expectations hugely yet stocks go down or barely up.

I know about priced in.

Doesn't that suggest that if tech stocks don't absolutely beat expectations they'll get sold off hard?

TSMC tomorrow should give an indication on the semi space. Everyone knows they've been running at 100% and we still got shortages so doubt we'll get upside surprise.
PINS treating us very well today, hoping for a real breakout here
COIN On trading 212 for 320 atm still not trading tho
At this point $MWK is my only speculative/risky stock and it is just killing me.
Part of me is deathly curious to see what the result of COIN debuting is, but most of me is just like...yeah, after lunch, let me get behind the wheel when I get to traveling and drive for a while, as I have a feeling in my gut what's going to happen.
NKE just gunna hover in the 130s forever I guess
TSM...you bum.
Have a feeling PLTR might take a shitter in the short-term as people looked towards double-click day to dump shares.
I’m confused about the Coinbase direct listing. Is the stock available right now or not? I don’t see any price action whatsoever. It’s just listed at $250 on every trading platform I’m on and there’s no movement
Coinbase is at $380 my limits was 400 anything higher than that I think it's too much
Today scares me.
I sold some stocks. Price went up

Then bought some stocks. Price going down today(schd msft)

such is life lol
Nio is an absolute joke I swear... 3% up in pre-market and yet plummetting yet again.

Completely and utterly incapable of keeping any upwards momentum.
Holy crap Tesla is already up like $25
Why is Coinbase still 250 an hour into the market being open?
Im ready for big tech to keep on ripping!
Coinbase ipo? What's peoples thoughts
Will COIN be available at market open?
What time is the coinbase IPO UK time?
At what time is coinbase becoming available? I can see the ticker on my app (degiro) with a price of 250, but can't buy/sell yet
Looking STRONG today!
Pretty happy I bought that steel dip! Jeebus, I’m nervous how high X and CLF are going....
AZ sports betting passed the Senate on Monday and first domino fell today. DKNG makes agreement with TPC Scottsdale to operate out of there and get mobile entry into AZ. Doesn't seem like much but its actually a really smart play by DKNG. Phoenix Open draws a ton of interest and it lines up with Super Bowl weekend (aka the most betted US Sporting Event)
Are people raising cash to go in deep on $COIN? Seeing a little red suddenly after being healthy green all morning.
If you had 10 million dollars and wanted to make like a 5% return each year for the next 10 years, what would y’all invest in?
Coinbase fees are so high compared to Binance in the UK. Why would the price go up so much?
Whys Disney rising suddenly today?
Age 35 and have 40 percent of my portfolio in individual stocks and 60 percent in index funds.  Is this a good balance for my portfolio?  Thank you
I don’t laugh at his jokes.
Is Coinbase supposed to be listing in around 10 mins?
Shorting RBLX. $50B valuations on this company are just laughable. The catalyst for 10% gains yesterday was... nerf guns and monopoly boards. This price level is coming down and hard. 

Look up the market cap of Hasbro... 13B. Annual revenue of Nerf guns? Laughably under $1b. Monopoly boards same story. But somehow this deal boosts Roblox's valuation by $5b. Whether or not Roblox is a winner long term doesn't matter, this price is going to lower before it goes up.
Dogecoin
I'm convinced there is a negative correlation between doing your DD and analysis and stock return growth. 

I have a tiny "dartboard" portfolio where I mirror the exact trading strategy as my short term portfolio (Sell at 15-20%, dip out at 10-15%, rinse repeat in general). I've been sinking in around 100 dollars a month into this, using a random stock generator to pick micro cap stocks for me. 

that portfolio is up 60% since Jan 1, while my short term is up 10%.
Thank you guys for teaching me how to invest. I went from being homeless sleeping in my car 3 years ago to now a official homeowner. I don’t post much but I’m grateful for everything
Holy shit the crypto market is PUMPING. Most insane bullrun. A lot of tokens going easy 50x which is madness.
Crypto goes down and everything even semi related to it turns around lmao
**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Today's a good day to trade in stocks that are usually terrible decisions. I have a hunch that some of our favorite meme stocks are going to see green days today. The rest of the market, however, is going to be pretty boring.

**Bull Case:**

* Earnings season has started and banks reported better than expected earnings. This resulted in big boosts for all three big banks -- which were then promptly erased and put back to normal.  
At an unscientific glance, this seems to be par for the course. It looks like, historically, earnings haven't been a big deal breaker for the big banks, which are already fairly valued.

**Bear Case:**

* J. Powell is speaking today, but it's not a particularly important speech and the market doesn't really seem to care.

Two big things are happening today, but I don't really think the market is going to care about either one. Today's going to see a slight pullback from yesterday's excitement, but should, on the whole, be fairly flat.

I'm forecasting a NASDAQ **high of 14,045** and a **low of 13,965**, with the market closing **red**, but I think it's going to be one of those so-close-to-neutral that it doesn't make a difference days.

Just been looking at NET (cloudflare) and the about of insider sells is crazy... (https://www.wallstreetzen.com/stocks/us/nyse/net/ownership) Why is this and why is it not worrying?
So I've never participated in anything like this before, but I'm a digital currency evangelist and I believe in it in my bones, so I'd like to grab some COIN. Realistically, where do I need to set my limits to ensure I get a few shares? Merrill currently has it at 250, but I know that the millisecond it's available the algorithms will snap it up and drive up the price...so what percentage is a decent cushion so I can set my limit order and focus on work today?  The documentation says the reference price is 250 but privately it traded as high as 375.  I don't know what to aim for.

Secondary question: I didn't realize it wouldn't start trading until this afternoon - I assumed it would be at 9:30. Is there any way to know exactly when it'll start trading?
CVAC already up almost 7% today!
Question: What’s a good formula to calculate how many shares you’d have to buy at a certain price to get the cost basis on your whole position to a certain value? Other than just doing averages over and over, is there a formula or online calculator to figure this out?

E.g, I have 10 shares at a cost basis of 10/share; how many would I have to buy at, say, 7 dollars to get my overall basis to x value?

Edit: I mathed wrong in my example so I fixed it. Thanks for pointing that out.
I can’t find COIN on fidelity obviously so I can’t set a limit order or an alert. Is there any way to get a jump when it starts trading?
would really love some input on the $WY situation. 

Is this jump a reflection of timber prices? Will it go down or is it justly valued. 

I'm in long but not entirely sure of whats going on tbh. I just like the stock!
Yesterday I sold some positions to pick up more DAL when it dipped but the lack of real-time settlement stinks.  Went into the upper 46 range but missed the dip.

Why is Fastly popping with everything sliding. Any news?
Cramer's been incorrect about the recent tech run but he's not wrong at all about there potentially being too much of a stock glut here. 

And it's mostly about institutions moving around money.
Looks like investors liked what Powell said.... i couldn't listen to the speech since i'm at work but i bet he said same shit as usual lol
OK, am I cursed?

GME was steady at 180 for a week, then as soon as I sell it jumps up to 200+

APPL and AMZN is steady for a month, I do a credit spread and it jumps way passed my spread on both!

I bought DIS on 3/11 when its been going up for the whole month and its suddenly bearish, then sell it yesterday after being bearish for a month, then it jumps up $4!!!
Should I buy some TSM since there releasing earnings report tomorrow?
Is anybody looking at $HSBC?  I missed out on the bank play and was looking for banks that haven't spiked insanely hard over the past few months -- it looks like HSBC is still under its pre-covid price.
I think I already know the answer to this, but is it possible to find production numbers on a company, or can you only find financial information? I want to see what product a company I like specialises in by their current production numbers. They have multiple products, so it's hard to know where they might be at in the next few years

What's a good order to put for coinbase at the start of market?,

I don't want to risk putting too low incase I miss out and then it rockets too high and I also don't want to put too high and have my broker sell above market price (has happened to me before).

VTI's climb since 3/25 has it on pace for over a 100% annualized return. As much as I would love that to continue, I know there has to be a pullback at some point.

Sold JPM. the fact that it’s dipping so much off of a great earnings report shows that the street thinks it’s overvalued. Not going to waste my time with that in my portfolio.

I don't know if this is the place for my question but: I started investing without a real "plan" and was just buying stocks/etfs without any real intention (portfolio is \~2.5k). I have since come up with how I would like to allocate my portfolio (i.e. I want 40% of my portfolio in X, 15% in Y, etc). What is the best approach to achieve this? Sell everything in my current portfolio and reinvest that cash? I don't know if there are any cons with this approach or if there's a better one

Here. Not even slightly tempted to buy.

Crypto is notorious for pump and dumps dictated by a relatively small number of whales. I wouldn't be surprised to see that happen today/tomorrow in both crypto and Coinbase stock.
I told myself I would never buy BTC, but FOMO is hitting and I might have been wrong, can't hurt to have a little exposure.  But now is an absolute horrible time to buy IMO.  I know it's that same old dumb advice "be fearful when others are greedy", but really.  This just looks insane right now. I'm out and sticking with my boomer stocks until I see what happens with this thing longer-term.  If it truly is going to be a bona-fide asset class for diversification then it won't really matter when we get in.

If it's just riding a wave then what goes up must come down.  That's how I look at it at least.  You could profit off it but I'm in this for the long-term.  Speculative buyers beware.
Having the same FOMO. Owned ETH, LTC and BTC a few months ago but sold them. Kicking myself cause id be up 100%+ on ETH. i do agree its ripping hard af and i for sure in 2021 fully expect a massive pullback at some point. It can only rip so high/ hard. 

On a personal mental level long term i struggle with the volatility and the 24/7 trading. The whole dropping 10% in one day being normal is a lot for me to handle and accept
You should read into the tech behind Ethereum and DeFi.
BLOK is the move
Bitcoin is real, bonds are becoming even more worthless, so bitcoin will simply be the way to beat inflation. I'm not even that concerned about inflation when it comes to the US market, but have been strongly recommending a bitcoin inflation "hedge" to anyone. Bitcoin is what bears think gold is supposed to be.
Maybe some fear about the upcoming Powell speech?


He will say nothing new but if the tone of his voice is slightly scary people will selloff as usual.
Nasdaq: I don't feel so good
If my order doesn't go through by lunch I'm canceling.
Thanks for the tip. Sold my qqq.
When the parks, cruise, hotels open likely...
Parks been open since 2020... just got back from Disney yesterday actually
Will this hurt the stock?
Retail isn't big enough to cause the movement that we've seen today or what was seen when DoorDash debuted. 

If you do end up seeing what was seen on the day it debuted, there's really not much we can do about it outside of say "that sucks." Not saying it will be like that, but the Nasdaq had been on a nice run into that day in December and then just randomly dumped nearly 2%. It was eye opening, and then it went back to chugging along after futures were a little scary the next morning.
Used to be until 2023. That’s some progress.
I guess that means two more years on the dancefloor. Lets go nasdaq 16k
You beat me to it. Wtf kind of question was that?
J Powell can just walk up on stage and breathe and the market will instantly start selling off
At this point i bet firms have a "jpowell" speak indicator which is the most reliable thing hahahha
If you cant react to the news guess in advance hahaha.
Looking at the markets I think that may be why.
I thought about liquidating part of my port to buy some coin. I consider myself a manager so i can verify this story.
Awesome company. Their valuations are pretty much in line with their historical earnings, so I would say they are one of the more reasonable stocks you can buy today.
I bought into it a few weeks ago. I loved the financials. Plus there is the very heavily rumored new version of the Switch that is supposed to come out this year.
I was thinking of buying some shares
Does seem like a fair price for a continually growing stock that kind of got dragged into the tech pullback.

I would be cautious in 2-3 years when they discuss their next console, specifically if they split the home/handheld device. But if they keep that model, I can't imagine anyone contesting them for the next half decade after that.
careful, them beating earnings doesn't garantee the stock will go up or be maintained once earnings come. It happens a lot that a stock beats earnings by a lot and then drop after earnings. Its all about Investors expectation. Still Roku is looking pretty good
They beat estimates today and the stock is still down 0.5% in pre market right now for some reason

Is there any bear case for JPM right now? I’m new at fundamental analysis but was analyzing the big banks yesterday, and JPM as well as RY look like great guys right now and I’m about to jump on
Bonkers
Might be, but I'm definitely not interested at 450
Sitting around with my financial dick in my hand and only $200 to try and push into the market.

Powell is speaking soon. Here's your reason.
Somethings green.  Bb.  Gme.  Prolly amc idk.
This is what day trades are for.
Bite the loss or average down.
I believe big players are expecting volatility due to COIN.
If it passed 143 I'd say yes.
From one bubble to another
It's overvalued though don't you think ?
Don’t know why anybody would be in Plug in the first place. That company is a total scam and a half.
I hope hell exists and he respawn in a simulation where he gets scammed over and over again.
AAPL is never not a good time to buy. As the saying goes , "when in doubt, buy aapl"
I trust Apple more than the us economy lmao
I’m sure it is. I personally added to my DIS position yesterday which looks good today and added to my MSFT position today.

I JUST SOLD MY LOSER OIL CALLS YESTERDAY :(
LA gas price is at 5 dollars, were not even at 70 dollar barrel, are we going to see 6 to 7 dollar gas? my NRGU going to reach 1000 lmao
All the reopening and travel stuff is up it seems. Not sure what the reason is but I'll take it.
Profits might do that but they have none
its gonna rubber band it to 22
back down to 22 after. If PLTR demo days were structured like Apple, maybe. but they are more concerned with a niche' audience who has a more intimate understanding of software. And rightly so, they want to demonstrate the essence of their product, not a marketing ploy to the masses. 

translation = it's not sexy, no one cares. stock down to 22 (buy more).
The market is from a historical perspective the majority of the time at ATH.

Rn voo is way, way up from the MAs

I'm betting it will drop down closer to the MAs but could be wrong
Try Holding a stock for a year selling half then somehow in 15 minutes it jumps 1.50 per share...wtf lol.

then I bought msft with it and today started barely red.

I sell. stock jumps
i buy. stock loses lol.

obv MSFT is long term and will only gain plus I love MSFT
weird it should open at 379
Lol. So you were watching that nonsense too?

350? I’ve seen it somewhere in the 400s. Not sure who is right anymore 

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/coinbase-pre-ipo-tokenized-stock-ftx/
Ugh waiting on a crappy platform, gonna be a while before I get access.
Degiro has it at 250 then at 340 and now back to 250. Guaranteed it'll open at 1000 or some nonsense like that.
Honestly tempted to gamble
gonna try and buy 2k worth when it opens, have a limit of 450 currently
I’ve been looking at JPM and ALLY. Furthest thing from an expert especially in this sector but been wanting to add a bank for diversification. JPM seems like a good stability holding and Ally seems to have more aggressive growth potential. But again, i’m not very smart at all in this sector so take my word with a grain of salt
Bloomberg said "number one app on the app store"
It's people selling the news. Give it a few weeks and they'll continue to rise.
It's hard to find many stocks in this market that aren't priced for perfection....it's a weird time to invest....a lot of these high multiple tech valuations need to continuously blow earnings out of the water just to not drop after, let alone go up
Short term reaction to earnings is often very unpredictable.
Up 33% YTD lol what do you want
I'm curious to know why you would own that stock? Such a low float makes it so open to swing trades.
What? Can you tell us what will happen?
Will go back to 140's once earnings are near. I hope so. Been continually buying the dip, their brand is unbeatable.
Technical analysis 100% supports your theory.
Its not live.
I am in the same boat. Have 3 shares at a limit of 400 and won’t go in if it opens higher.
The r/stocks ETF consisting of SE NET AAPL and NIO is green. Maybe there is some other r/stocks pick that i missed but all the ones i can think of are green.
MSFT is down 0.023% in the premarket.

I think you can afford to wait for some *slightly* worse news before panicking.
u dumb
If I see any + in pre market I just know it means that when the market opens it is gonna be red
I might get in when it hits 25
Why is Tesla going up?  Is it related to Coinbase and BTC?

If so, that just shows how absolutely stupid those picks are right now (unless you're able to get out before the dump).  They have nothing to do with each other except that Elon owns a small amount of BTC and the same locos who are bullish on BTC love Tesla, too.
As someone new who brought tesla with binance would you recommend holding it? It seems to be dropping a bit...
Don’t worry, it’s at $350 now. And still not open.
These things never open at the bell.

Kind of silly, but it is what it is.
It's trading at 535
Bitcoin is steamrolling through a new all time high, count me in on coin as early as possible today
Hitting peak mania today.
I had set aside funds to buy in but at that price i'm just going to buy more ETH instead.
Gonna be a pump and dump, hard pass for me.  Won't be buying later either, but if you're gonna buy, at least wait a little bit.

IMO.
Would rather own MSTR
No
probably around 1pm but no one knows for sure
There isn't a set time but I would imagine around 6pm it hits
But just put an order of 10 for a price of 275.  I don't think I will get it at that price anyways...
My broker app said that it's not certain we can trade COIN today due to not meeting listing requirements of European regulation.
Why did you choose dkng and not entain?
Hope I get a nice bump in my DKNG shares today!
I don't invest in companies that I think make the world worse, but if I did DKNG would have to be high on the list. They have great brand recognition and have been making plenty of smart moves.
I heard big banks are liquidating their entire portfolio to buy COIN.
I think that's why crypto looks kinda wobbly. Discount on cstr and hut.
If you have funds rebalancing to include it then yes, there will be plenty of selling.
I sold a bit of msft to free up some cash in case I want to buy COIN.
I'm down 9.5%, so yes.
I sold some GME to have money ready for COIN.
VOO
Property and stay out of the stock game, you already have 10 mill lol
I'd take the Warren Buffet approach and S&P 500 that bitch.
A house
Baba, big pharma, health insurance stocks. Also big pharma and health insurance stocks can still rise with their valuations even there is another recession, they are close to unlosable right now.
That's what makes them more money than Binance lol.
Did they recently announce parks reopening?
Parks April 30, the Avengers theme park in June. Presale tickets tomorrow I believe expected to sell out at a premium. Etc.
Which index funds are you in? I'm hoping to diversify a lot more.
Watch it list at 700 or something ridiculous.
Yea that basically announced some new weapons. I thought for sure it wouldve dropped by now. But either way I'm waiting
How can doge be worth that? It literally is infinite, how could a resource that has infinite supply go up in value?
This is some market crash shit.
Always own SOME crypto
Goes down? Pls don't exaggerate
Very hard day to predict. Gl!
There’s one analyst says it’s price target is 600
Idk but one thing is for sure- I’m waiting a few weeks to see where it levels out at before considering buying in.
opening at 600? yes. Not gonna drop anytime soon though - not while this market lasts.
i hope this is just a temporary COIN related dip, and doesn't trigger a big sell off like last time
It was too good to be true
Why would you sell?
Wait for the earnings
It's not an insane amount being sold. Probably just realizing their gains, Capitalist gotta use money to eat too
No way of knowing when it will start trading. Futures had COIN trading at $588 earlier today.
shouldve bought it at 83, fucking jj lmao
Infinite shares at 7 would never get your CB down to 7....
This equation cannot be solved for. Your cost basis will never reach 7. If you say you wanted your cost basis to be $6 (basically anything below 7), then that's possible.

&#x200B;

\[(10 times Original Share Price) + (X times Current Share Price)\]/(10 + X) = 6

X = 30 shares
you can use goalseek in excel to figure out how many shares you need at a certain price to hit the CB you want.
If my math is correct, you would need to buy about 70 shares at $7 to bring your average cost down to near $7/share

[10(10) + 7x ] ÷ (10 + x) = 7

Simplified as:

10+7x = 7



(10 + 7x) ÷ 7x = (7 ÷ 7x)

10 = 7 ÷ 7x

70 = x


To check my work I averaged [10(10) + 7(70)] / 80 =$7.375

You'll never be able to get your average  cost to $7 exactly if you're buying at $7/share, because your average cost per share is already higher than that
I just saw it its there https://i.imgur.com/I00h7mc.jpg
> And it's mostly about institutions moving around money.

always has been
They arent even talking about anything meaningful today
Lesson is buy and HOLD. A month is nothing in the life of Disney lol.
Maybe the saying “don’t try to time the market” has some merit. Weird.
Interested to know this too. Sold some GME shares to get into COIN, but if that opens too high (over $500), I'll leave it and reinvest in something else. TSM feels a lot more reasonable at $121 now.
Idk anything about the stock but not a fan of the bank. They’ve been caught laundering money for the cartel, terrorists, and Russian mob. Also just saw an article a few days ago where they took an anti crypto stance (can’t remember exactly what they did but it was something negative for corporations that crypto hsbc was behind).. idk though I feel like most massive banks are too big to fail so the stock might be a good play
I'm a bit coy on banks right now, especially with the news in Ireland - one bank (Ulster Bank) is transitioning out of the country and another (Bank of Ireland) is shutting a high portion of branches as the banking habits of people have changed.
If you are an everyday person and thinking about if a stock has been priced in, it has most likely been priced in.
I'm holding on to some shares in IAG
Spy 180p all the way
Relax, it's still up 8.5% over the past month.
Bear spray?
I know it’s so fucking bad lol.
I'd sell. It's dropping from the resistance.
I predict a dip on open sending the market back to its state in the mid-1980s, followed by a rocket beyond ATHs at lunch, and a gradual descent throughout the rest of the day, with SPY ending +0.05% for the day
I sold this morning lol

edit: to buy COIN, which is probably going to be rejected 

F
I have no idea what drives the price of Disney, but certainly happy to see that movement this morning.
Yeah, thats also a very short time period to try to extrapolate over an entire year.
I'd love to see it a little bit lower, but yeah, hard to ignore AMD under $80.
This is why you don't day trade.
10 minutes of basic research on NIO while you're pooping would tell you that it's not a bust
One at risk of delisting the other is Winnie Pooh
I imagine most people planning on buying it have already allocated some cash before today.
yes. my entire portfolio is down 1.5% when it was up 0.5% this morning
I’m sitting trying to decide when is the right time to finally offload my Delta shares.  It’s had a good run and I think most of the recovery is priced in, but I’m sure we can still get maybe up to 5% before it starts acting like a standard cyclical.
That's what she said
Banks already rallied pretty hard.

Didn't say it in here but it's no surprise that they had to be amazing.

Wouldn't be surprised if GS got sold as well (although I'm not looking).
They're going higher.
if you like the fundamentals and think they'll grow big

most just swing/daytrade them
What's so intriguing about them?
The only thing to consider is capital gains tax. If you are fine with that, then there are no other concerns.
My personal opinion is for you to look at what you got and see what you believe in. Maybe spend a few weeks doing a deep dive on all your holdings. Just see what you think is legit and will continue to grow and sell what you think are not going to grow. Reinvest the money into VTI and forget about it until the next round of earnings and see the current stocks that you had conviction in. If you still have faith in them keep them, if not just sell and reinvest in VTI. Re-do this until you get to 6-7 positions you strongly believe in. Not financial advice though I am fucking stupid
Hahaha. Up \~1% in 25 minutes.
Pretty sure it will be over $500 all day
It will drop in a month or two, wait for the dip.
That's never going to fill unfortunately.
Earnings soon?
I sat on my Ford stock for years. I kept telling myself with every bit of good news that it would go up. It never happened. I waited until it went up just enough to not take a loss and sold it all. No regrets.

I don't understand why this stock never seems to move more than a couple of % +/-.
Damn it, I missed it. Any idea why oil price is increasing?
You just don't understand bro.

(Jk)
Wife texted me the other day “Hey, I was talking to the neighbor. You should look into crypto.” All the proof I needed that the current top is in lol.
It's not a terrible time to buy. Look at the tech roadmap for ethereum over the next 12 months and see if you come to the same conclusion.
Good thing it's not supposed to be used a currency or anything.

Oh wait...
Gold has been a pretty solid investment long-term.  It may not make you a lot of money, but it has certainly been able to preserve it.  I'm not sure what you mean by "supposed to be".

Bitcoin rocketing up 800% in 1 year in the midst of a deflationary environment is not exactly a hedge.  It's speculative.  You can still enjoy the ride but BTC is simply not acting as an inflation hedge at the moment, anymore than Tesla stock is.
Is there a strong correlation that shows Bitcoin as an actual hedge against inflation, or is it just assumption? Genuinely curious
My guess is the first half of your comment. Investors are selling in anticipation of Powell's address, so they won't have losses if there's a surprise. And if he says exactly what everyone expects, they will buy back in.
Disney World has been open, but Disneyland is scheduled for later this month. I'm not sure about their international parks.
Awesome! Great to hear! What was capacity like? Hoping it’s full go for the summer peak season.

I’ve been wanting to drink around the world at Epcot for awhile after this crazy year
Sure thing buddy - institutions too. COIN just needs to get out there to calm everyone down
Every bit of bad COVID news has tanked banks this year. With reopening and rising interest rates they will win big by end of year I think. For instance the bad JNJ news and rates plummeting yesterday killed them.
My prediction is over 700$.
He’s gonna cause more bleeding I can feel it
When will he speak exactly?
See. Someone gets it
The only problem is it’s impossible to set your spawn in the nether
Their valuations stopped making sense to me by January. Plan is to sell when it becomes long and wait for the next market panic before getting back into airlines.

I'll go bigger next time though.
It might change when it goes live. It went from 250 - 340 - 250 and now 500.
Is it still worth getting LTC? Feel like that's skippable these days.


I did basically do this strategy in 2017 and it turned out nicely by now. Looking at all the craziness going on though and trying to prepare
Pineapple power has done really well recently too
Bloomberg just updated again. Now 355
WFC - has lagged the rest of the banks due to federal restrictions imposed some time ago.  Good earnings announcement this morning combined with easing of court-imposed measures bode well for their future.  

JPM is an all-star among banks.
Wtf
Damn, I'm afraid to jump in now lol
34% why does that bug you so much?
PINS last hit high 80's 2 months ago and since been trading in a range, as you can see we've failed to push ATH today leading us back to 85. Don't get me wrong I've been in since 35 but for any traders getting in the last 2 months I'm sure this is a frustrating ticker for them and they'll be looking for said breakout. Very happy with the gains so far and hoping it continues to be a quiet runner
there was some dude talking about it a ton in here like a month ago, haven't seen him around anymore. I'm guessing some people bought in, never really saw the appeal.
Well it did great for me for a ride from $33 to $47. But I didn’t sell and knew it would dip a bit, but didn’t expect to see $25.

And it’s my one speculative “play”. I think the company has a great concept, they’ve been smart with the companies they’ve bought (imo), they’ve expanded well.

And I’m new to this and this stock has definitely taught me a lot so far, didn’t plan on that but it did.
It's possible that the selling continues so institutions and big players that are interested can get in on COIN.
Tech is still trending up overall but is taking a dip today as growth oriented money is freed up for COIN
The same I'm only going to buy three
The exuberance around COIN and cryptos is scaring me idk.
Msft ia long term. Im not worried just always seems when I buy stocks the next day or two they drop some lol
Tesla got multiple rating and target upgrades most above 1000 in the last week. Based on them becoming an energy platform.
Didn't Tesla buy like $1-2 billion in bitcoin a couple months back?

Their stock movement will be linked to bitcoin for a while longer
Ya idk but I guess that’s a likely possibility
Tsla was oversold
Welp time to change my position now
How can you see what it is?
You and everybody else!
At what price?

How come you changed your mind? I can see some quick profit buying the dip, it's likely to bounce back if this Crypto surge continues.
You're not a believer in crypto then?
When is it available then?
It's 2:22pm in the UK right now, lol.

I will presume you meant Eastern time.
Try 600
their app is great too. Very good UI
+1


But i'd estimate its going to be closer to 10% when including dividends.
Ah I never thought like that. I would assume all customers are rationale and pick the lowest fees.
I'm in VTSAX,VXUS and VGT.
Tokenized versions of the stock are in mid 400's right now (low 600's this morning). Who knows how well that correlates to what it will be at market, but I kind of doubt we will see $700. Maybe back to $600.
So is Ethereum and that’s not stopping people in any way
I love how salty people downvote this. Haha. If people wanna make their money in crypto then so be it. Tbh I’m fascinated watching from the sidelines. People are becoming millionaires overnight. Dogecoin (which was created originally years ago as a joke) has gone 50x in the last 3 months.
It does feel a lot like 2017. And this Coinbase dpo is adding to the frenzy
big rip
Im gonna see what it actually opens at then go from there
Same.... shoulda sold my calls this morning
Well shit I don't have that much money haha.  Thanks for this.
Yeah I figured that out as soon as I posted. So forget that and assume some other value between 7-10.
Yeah, I realized my mistake as soon as I posted. Bad example values. But this is exactly what I’m looking for. Thank you!
This is not correct. You cannot solve for X. His cost basis will never be 7. You could buy an infinite number of shares and it will still be above 7.
They just have just added after I posted. I see it now too. Thanks!
That's my point though. The current climb isn't sustainable.
Just set your limits and walk away. The market will probably eventually pass your point.
It just hurts being down 20%
GS is up for now, could change fast though.
Barely. I might should’ve waited on WFC but they’re not going much higher than they are right now. Already priced in beating on earnings.
The platform they have created is pure genius in my opinion. Restaurants can use it to manage all their delivery providers in one place so all orders end up on the same platform, whether its ordered through UberEats, Doordash, the restaurant itself, delivery or collection. They can then get detailed statistics on how each is performing etc... Probably didn't explain that well at all but would recommend listening to ChitChatMoney podcast about it
1.5% now. For an index, that's insane, is it not?
Got it. So I'll likely wait for a dip.. If it happens lol. But let's say I'm bullish on Coin to be 700+ by end of week.. What would be the order I'd place to get in early as possible, and I guess just miss out on the opening price.
With bitcoin selling so high right now, I expect shares to mirror that.
Does anyone know when it actually starts trading? I still can't see it at any price. Market's been open for 30 minutes now.
Yeah sigh
Intel is like in 7 days, and its down lol
Jesus.
Every single January first, bitcoin has been worth substantially more than the past year. It's designed to beat inflation, and while I don't consider it primarily as a currency, unlike gold people will actually buy things with bitcoin. You should probably read investor advice on bitcoin instead of just going along with what sounds good to you. I wouldn't bet a cent on gold beating inflation compared to bitcoin.
The theory is that since the supply of BTC is known and capped, central banks can't simply print more of it.  Printing more causes inflation.  BTC is inherently deflationary, actually, because some BTC will be lost over time.

It makes sense, but almost all of the value in BTC is because people *say* it has value.  Sure, it has utility simply because it can't be tampered with by central banks, and because you can make transactions off the grid.  But you could do the same with any crypto currency, and some are even better at it, arguably.

People say BTC has value today, tomorrow they might decide that it doesn't.  That's the danger.

In order for us to test our hypothesis that BTC actually works as a hedge against inflation, we'd need to wait several years or even a couple of decades.  We don't know right now, and all we can gather is that it's as good as Tesla stock in that regard.  Ie, anything that goes up in value is obviously good against inflation.  That doesn't mean that Tesla's place in a portfolio is as an inflation hedge.
No, it is most likely related to the big IPO because this is not a new story here.

I saw this with Snowflake, and I saw this with DoorDash and it became VERY noteworthy in the case of the latter. 

The Nasdaq had been in a very strong uptrend and it ****ing dumped on the day DoorDash debuted.

There isn't **** that we can do about it.
With a DPO, are they able to just decide the time it's listed? With IPO's they have to list at 9:30 am (EST) correct?
They are running 35% capacity but it still felt busy. Lines were like 30-45 min at most. Kinda hard to imagine how they ever ran full capacity honestly. 

They were psycho about masks even on the little kids. Was actually super annoying. 

Still was fun tho.
If you were to see what was seen with the debut by Dash to an extent, COIN being put out there is not going to do what you think it will.
noon
They were my first ever investment back in January, only put £10 in to make sure I wasn't fucking everything up... the next day they were up 80%

They've been leaking since then but finally are seeing some movement
I got a bunch of Unilever when it dropped to £38. Dipped further to 37.33, since then gradual rise. Impressive for a slow moving dividend stock.
Thanks for the insight! Will definitely take a deeper look at WFC.

And like you said, JPM is just an all-star so i figure you can never go wrong there.
If you are long, it’s a good price. Short term I’ll be in under $80
Wdym? I'm saying it's already up 34% and he's talking about "the real breakout", just saying to have realistic expectations. I'm also in PINS FYI
Fair, I've seen this stock before but I don't know much about it. I tend to avoid low float stocks myself as they are very volatile.
What could possibly go wrong?
Yep
Which is hilarious because that will never happen.
Thank you.
Yeah but they hold $19 billion total in cash and cash equivalents.  Only $1.5 billion of that is in Bitcoin.  That's nothing.

It's irrational behavior on the part of investors and makes me very skeptical.
That's how I'm reading it unless someone has a better plausible explanation.
475 now 

https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/coinbase-pre-ipo-tokenized-stock-ftx/
CNBC said it'll start at $250 today. At that price I feel better just putting more money into ETH. I've become a believer in Ethereum over the past few months.
No.
lmao yes I might need another coffee lol
Haha how long U.K. time do you know?
No way jose!
Can you onboard fiat to crypto on Binance?  It couldn't when I was on there a couple years ago.  Had to buy on Coinbase, then send Btc to Binance to trade altcoins.  That's why I use CB and pay CB fees.
thats good. consider some SCHD. good dividend and has growth too.
Well, I hope they're right because I dont want to see anyone lose their money. It may quadruple in price in the next 5 years or it make be worth as much as doge is currently. Too much volatility and not enough logical sense for my taste.

I say we all buy chuckecheese coins and make that the new global currency, it's about the same amount of logic.
Oh yeah agree people can do what they want with their money, also not touching it but shit, if the markets were to crash this year it'd be because of new crypto millionaires or some shit
Chances are itll open and spike up very high like most IPOs do, then in a few days probably go down, but then again there has never been an IPO like this before, so like who knows
Yeah that's why it came to 7.375 and not 7. OP asked for a formula, and used $7 as his example, so that's what I used
I also edited my comment to address that, but I'm guessing you already were on the page before my edit so you wouldn't have seen that
Had to make a limit order and not an actual buy sadly
I was looking at it yesterday and saw that it's pulled in 5% in the past month. Had to do a double take.
I disagree. But if you believe your money is better elsewhere then go for it.

With rising inflation on the horizon, banks will do well. They have underperformed for years, and even with the recent runup have a lot of room to run. They have tons of cash, so dividends and buybacks are gonna continue to grow.
It is. But sounds about right for the markets at the moment. Insane.
Whenever your brokerage let's you. I'd wait a couple weeks tho dude
It wont be until this afternoon at least
It's down because of recent Nvidia news
Check this out:

https://moneyandmarkets.com/gold-inflation-hedge/

Gold went through a long bear market but the price of gold matched the CPI  exactly after 40 years, starting in 1980.  

BTC going up substantially every year does not mean it's an inflation hedge, any more than MSFT is an inflation hedge.  You could argue it's a good investment.  Fine.  But inflation hedges are *hedges*, they're not designed to make you rich. They're designed to protect you against inflation.

The problem I see is that BTC fiends are calling it an inflation hedge, but at the same time it's not acting that way at all.  It's acting very differently.  If the true value of BTC were to hedge against inflation, it should not have gone up 800% in 52 weeks, when the CPI was mostly below 2%.  

So if the true value isn't coming from its supposed properties as an inflation hedge, where is it coming from?  And is that source of value something you're willing to bet on?

For me, at the moment, no.
Thank you for that explanation. That helped. I reread your paragraph twice, and found that you could replace BTC with gold and the meaning essentially stays the same. Just an interesting anecdote
Can you clarify something for someone who does not know much/anything about crypto. You say the amount of BTC is capped but isn't that incorrect? Because you can buy .0000001 of a BTC right? And you can buy .00000000000001 so, in theory, doesn't that make the amount of it uncapped?
 I didn't remember the market dropping when Doordash was listed, but I just looked at some charts and it looks like you are right
No, it's the same story with both cases. They debut at who knows when and in the case of DoorDash, the market steadily worsened for the entire day, with the Nasdaq getting dumped hard on that day.
Disney World at full capacity is absurd, but well managed. Lines can take two hours, but if you're smart with their easy pass system, you'll get a lot out of the day without being stuck in those horrid lines. It's impressive, but it still sucks to feel like you're crammed basically everywhere. 35% sounds like heaven.
Well fuck
All my other money in my brokerage is in VOO, AAPL, MSFT, WMT, WM, and CRSR. I’m still doing well, I just picked MWK as my speculative “play” and don’t have that much into it. It just isn’t fun to see such a large drop. I have definitely learned a lot about low float stocks.
Crypto holders could come to their senses? Haha just kidding bitcoin 120k next year.
Never bet against a cult. I can see tesla going over 1k by EOY.
It's exaggerated for sure, but that's how things are right now

Plus tech/ev looking green again further adds to it
When a stock moves without some crazy news known to public there is news in the background that we haven't heard of yet. I've seen tiny bars with massive volume on TSLA's chart recently and that tells you one thing - insiders know something.
We will never see 250 it will open at 500 or more imo.
I'm just worried about the potential for a crash.. Whenever that MAY happen.
Why?
The estimate they've given here would be 6pm UK time.
Dude its going to go through the roof
What did you put in at? 350?
Yeah, I don't see a reason to invest in anything else right now while it's on this run.
I was only holding two, and I think the street overshot on the bank stocks. WFC is up 4% and I should’ve waited. That’s on me. But JPM has traded sideways for weeks and dropped on exceptional earnings which tells me a lot.
And laptops sold a shit ton, intel owns that market.
The crazy thing is all these people "buying" BTC on brokerage apps dont actually own any crypto.
Sure!

Not exactly, though.  Gold is used in the manufacturing of mobile phones as well in things like golden teeth.  It's used in jewelry, too, although jewelry pretty much has value because it looks pretty and we say it has value, true.  But we do use it to make things.  BTC isn't used to make anything.

Gold also has been used as money for millennia, and all of the worlds central banks are literally holding tons of it.  This is a case of "people say it has value", true.  But it's more time-tested than BTC which has only been around for about 10 years.  

If BTC proves itself in the next few years or decades it could take on a similar role.  Right now, however, it's still acting very volatile and we don't have any proof of its long term viability.
It's still capped.  Think of it like dividing into $1 into 100 cents.  The part we're splitting is still the same whole: $1.  Even if we made microcents it'd still be the same thing.

The capping thing runs into trouble when you consider that there are OTHER cryptos.  Yeah, BTC is capped but there's also Ethereum, etc. meaning the cypto world itself is not capped.
Thanks for clearing that up. Looks like COIN will be $450-$500 when it does list. At $250 I'm OK, but $500 is too risky this early on.
I got some pics at the end of the day with the castle with no one in the picture. Definitely once in a lifetime there. 

Fast passes are definitely key to a successful day. Unfortunately they aren't using them right now. But you do have to reserve your park for the day. 

It was nice to walk through the park and not bump into people
Yeah I think we all get burnt now and then on bad bets, not to say that MWK won't go back soon.

 The more I look at MSFT chart over time, the more I reckon its the best company in the world.
The stock price sure lol But they will never deliver on the fundamentals or valuations in a million years.
Indeed, but a cause for concern IMO.  I'm not pulling out of the market, but I'm not touching those speculative stocks and assets with a 10 foot pole.  Boomer stocks and index funds look good to me. 

Agreed it's related to tech/ev as well.
BTC has gone up 7% in the last two days.  Tesla 11-12%.  Call me crazy but I think it's related.  Might not be insiders.  Could be a pump and dump.  Let's see.
It's always possible. It crashed in 2018, I guess we'll see. Best of luck if you buy into COIN
Check out my comment history, I've made a few comments in this thread.
I put at 250 this morning I’ll probably change it once i see how its doing
Sounds like you're trading them and not investing. 


Personally I'm long financials to balance out the tech side of my portfolio. Sideways trading for a few weeks is normal, as is selling on a great earnings report. Doesn't move the needle for me with a long term outlook.
Could you elaborate or hit me with a link?  I'm not totally in the loop about this.
I never expected them to sell a single car, they keep surprising me who knows. I own them by owning the nasdaq i suppose. I remain sceptical but its not outside of the realm of possibilities.
Maybe so!
I read a few of your comments and it just confused me really. Are you against crypto generally or just BTC? In a comment a while back you said FOMO is hitting you hard and ‘couldn’t hurt to have a little exposure’ to it. Why expose yourself to something you don’t believe in?
Any update? Had mine set at 250 and updated to 280. If it hits 500, I might leave it.
So places like coin base let you "own" it but they still hold it for you. Robinhood is basically trading the price, not possible to access any actual crypto.

You dont really own any crypto until you transfer it to a hard wallet and have it disconnected from the internet
I'm against crypto generally speaking as I don't think it's been properly tested and I'm skeptical about its long-term value.  However, I could be proven wrong, and long-term it may act in a similar way as gold and precious metals/commodities have in the past.  

We're simply not sure if it's the future or not.  Buying Bitcoin or crypto is still a gamble at this point. 

The main problem I have with it at present it that it seems to be riding a highly speculative bubble.  Now is a horrible time to buy, IMO, although I may be wrong and people might continue to profit for months and years.  Or not.  A lot of people could be left holding very big bags.  It's not a risk I'm willing to take right now, because that's not how I invest.  That stuff is for /r/wallstreetbets.

If in the end it does prove to have long-term value, then as I said in one of my comments, the price won't really matter.  I can get in later. Assets that have long-term value are generally stable, otherwise they wouldn't really have long-term value.  BTC is not stable right now and won't be until its long-term value is established, if that day ever comes.

Hope that makes sense.
Well that's dumb.  Hopefully people who buy BTC actually do so in a way that allows them to hold it.

Thanks for explaining.
crypto has outperformed every single stock in the stock market. Crypto is the future in terms of how companies can utilize efficiency in their structure of business. You’re old school money/boomer if you think crypto isn’t going anywhere or it’s just gonna crash. it’s literally backed by some of the biggest whales. It’s too big to fail now, I think you’re comparing crypto to it’s early stages of 2010. 

Btw it crashed in 2017 harder than any stock market crashed, yet it rallied on some of the most insane bull runs I’ve seen.
TITLE: Apple Mac shipments grew more than 110% year-over-year in Q1 2021TEXT: 'The Cupertino tech giant shipped an estimated 6.7 million Mac models in Q1 2021, up from an estimated 3.1 million shipments in Q1 2020, according to new data from analysis firm IDC. The surge represents growth of 111.5% year-over-year.

Apple's share of the market also grew during that period, from 5.8% in the first quarter of 2020 to 8% in the first quarter of 2021. Apple clocked in fourth among the top PC vendors, behind Lenovo, HP, and Dell. None of those companies saw the same type of growth, however.

The entire PC market also saw a continued surge in growth in the first quarter. Global shipments of desktops, notebooks, and workstations grew 55.2% year-over-year.'

Source:  https://forums.appleinsider.com/discussion/221091Throw in the latest $1200 stimulus check with the M1 chip success & iPhone 12 success... I think 2021's gonna be a good year for AAPL.
And I laughed hysterically while pouring money into AAPL when CNBC had a headline in February that said “is apple now boring?” Because the share price was stuck in the mud at 120
Oh boy, I can’t wait for this good news to alter the stock price in no way!
I sold some AAPL to help restructure my portfolio. Kinda wish I didn't now, but I've still got 13 @ 121.09. My future profits and deposits are going into AAPL; that's my retirement
I guess the stock price is way behind the new processors and what it means for Apple. I keep buying more, it’s the biggest jump we’ve seen in years. They will move a ton of these new macs this year. M1 is just the beginning. I think people expect growth from services with Apple but IMO they will be surprised with numbers from laptops/desktop sales. For couple years it won’t make sense to buy any other hardware
I figure there is tremendous pent up demand for Apple Products with their stores closed.  Many people like the experience of going into their stores to make purchases.  Being conservative my guess is that $1 in $10 of stimulus money will make it's way to Apple cash registers.  My son and I talked about how much of his $1400 would go to spending.  He works 2 jobs now and honestly didn't need to spend any of it today.  He lives at home and has no bills.  He only gets a portion of his earnings to spend freely.  He is saving (towards a car) now that his emergency fund is funded and investing (toward a house down the road).  We settled on $400 to spend.  $500 towards the car fund and $500 into his investment acct.  I moved the money at noon.  By 5pm he was at Target buying an Apple watch, around $280.  I am looking at a watch, but will wait.  I also should replace my phone soon as it is over 5 years old.
Yep... you guys called it. Apple shit the bed on great news... again
Serious question: let’s say apple has growth quarter after quarter, but people don’t invest in for some reason. Will Apple’s stock still go up or ..? 
The reason I’m asking is that there are many great stocks out there and they are doing great , but no matter what those stocks do they don’t seem to be going up
I just have to remind myself of all the people who shit on Apple when the iPods were out.... “but the Zoom!” 

Or the iPhone: “It’s a girl’s phone, BB is for business!” 

Or my old Schwab manager (who is about to get fired) when he said, “Idk about Apple, Steve Jobs died.” 

There’s a lot of noise, and not a lot of DD when people talk Apple. 

The company has their shit together, and it’s so obvious when you buy their products, use their services, or have a warranty issue.
Isn't this usually data that comes out at earnings?
Can it move please. Best run company in the world and it's basically flat since September.
Apple phone is crazily user friendly, to the point it surprises me. I set my alarm last night for 5AM. This morning I woke up a little bit earlier, around 4.45, decided to just get up anyway so I grabbed my phone and started going through the messages. The phone then sensed that I was up and sent me a notification asking if I wanted to turn off the alarm.

I’m just so glad I got into apple stock. I got 60 shares of it.
Wow.  Everyone I know is holding out for the 16in M1.  They’re going to the moon this year.
Buy on the rumor, sell on the news
Damn, I get it though - also been wishing for that M1 
Just need the money part first
Awesome, can't wait for my apple stock to go down for some reason
The funny thing is that although the laptops themselves do create profit for Apple at the cost they sell it to customers, the real money is in the data collection those devices do for Apple that indicate customer behavior, habits, and purchasing. Apple's "factory store" model for the 21-Century is indeed working; it's brilliant, people pay to get stuff from Apple, that makes Apple money after the point of purchase. Got to love Congress for letting that happen (sarcasm). GLTA
Let’s go
so.. calls or shares?
How will the chip shortage affect profits this year?
Well my M1 MacBook Air is an absolute killer. Excel, Photoshop, Premiere, War Thunder in high FPS for only 1.399 EUROs! Love it.
I bought a new MacBook with my money I made in stocks then lost it all.  Too bad I can’t return it now.
[deleted]
Well most companies compared to 2020 are doing great, what about 2019?
What recession ?
Do we really need Aapl DD anymore? It’s an automatic yes from me dawg.
Apple dipped a bit, time to buy. I'm too cash dry to snag a bunch of shares right now, but I just got more long term calls. I think Apple is a license to print right now. 

I was afraid it was going to run too hot after the last couple weeks, so I'm glad it's cooling off for at least a day.
Apple and Disney are my retirement stocks. Not touching those for 20-30 years.
Because the new ones break sooner than these old <2013 Models.

Also all these “gates” like battery, butterfly or flex. gate.

Since Jobs is gone Apple products did lost some quality.
[removed]
Lol Mac's are garbage for everything idk how anyone wastes their money on them; bad price for performance, bad for gaming, bad for school work, difficult to repair compare to other brands. Awful.

Downvoters mad they spent money on a Macbook when they could have got a similar priced laptop of another brand with double the performance capabilities LOL.
I wonder if they cry when they realize Macs are worthless for mining.
That’s because their shitty keyboard designs forced most corps that issue Macs to buy new ones for all employees this year.
Unfortunately I bought at their peak a few months ago! But I'm holding long-term so it's not an issue
Thank god I spent my entire stimulus check money on AAPL during the dip last month.
Oh just wait til they have another amazing earnings call, and then go red for two weeks
*$1,400
Yep. I bought at the $116/$117 dip. Don’t own a lot, but just happy to be in.
Also, they fixed the laptop keyboards that have sucked ass for a few years. I was putting off buying a new one mainly because of those. Now waiting for the new ones to get discounted or sold as refurbed with the next line updates.
smart ones bought the dip...and amzn too : )
fuck em, i enjoyed the 120 price
New plan: do the opposite of what CNBC suggests
Bought some calls when the stock was down there...up 40% and 25% on those!
CNBC are a bunch of fools and tools. They have zero credibility anymore (if they ever did)
Lol srsly. Saw the headline and was stoked for 2 seconds only to realize this will do nothing to the price movement
It will go down obviously...
As always, this and everything is priced in.
That was pretty fucking funny.
Goes down...WTF...
It will show in their earnings. Patience is key!
You have to CRUSH estimates for the stock not to go down. Remember, this company has gone up 2-3x ib last 2 years but earnings have been flat.

Macs are going to become more relevant for consumers but it's still going to be an uphill battle against Windows for most professional/business use imo. Services is still going to be really important for them.

These machines are truly insane though. They're barely even trying and they knock it out the park. They just shoved the M1 into last year's Pro body without touching the internals, no changes to the cooling solution and it screams. Once Apple increases the core counts and puts these in a machine with even more power and better cooling it's going to get crazy.
What do you mean by it won't make sense to buy any other hardware?
Unless you want windows, or like building your own shit, or want to get the same exact specs for half the money, or don't want to be locked into Apple's ecosystem...
I wish we could get actual data on the stimulus like that. I'd love to see what goes to food, missed payments, shoes, tech, stocks, etc.
Yes. Stock should still go up.

If there's a company on nobody's radar, that releases amazing growth quarter over quarter what happens?

Well they should be collecting lots of cash on their balance sheets which they can use to buyback stock.

If the stock holders are willing to sell their stocks for cheaper than it's worth given the company's growth, then great, the company's EPS will rise even faster.

Let's say no matter what the company does, people don't want to pay more for it.

Well then if they're bought back soo many shares with no price movement that the PE ratio is < 5 or something they can just pay a 20% dividend yield and share holders will be collecting $$$.

In short, stock will always follow the company's performance, at least on a long enough time frame.
It's not that they don't go up, it's that it's already priced in. Professional investors get these sorts of news *long* before the public, either via their industry models, private research sources, or just straight up inside connections. Retail is always the last to know, that's why from your perspective it's a bunch of random movements, but from the perspective of a professional fund, it's a sophisticated game.

Look at it this way - say a high-level executive at Apple just *happens* to hint at the company's plans to enter electric vehicles at a private party, who's going to be able to prove it in the court of law? Yet that piece of information could drive stock prices for months among those in the know, before retail even catches a wind of it. That's why retail can never actually win - optimal trading is about having access to information that you don't have - and is better off investing in the over all market than individual companies.
That works for speculative companies, but what is speculative on Apple fundamentally?  They have news almost every day. What news are you selling on?
It's the first sentence of the post.
100 units -> 210 units if 110% growth
You’re not wrong and the cult is strong. People don’t realize apple laptops have out dated hardware and cost $500-$1k more than a comparable windows laptop. They’re a rip off but people care more about what others think than the actual product they use. Gotta look cool in front of your friends!!
/r/IAmVerySmart
sure bro lol
I bought some near the peak, but I've averaged down into the mid 120s during the dips. It's a long term hold for me as well.
I have been buying apple for years and I can promise you that wasn't their peak. They will keep hitting new ATH so don't worry about it.
I initially bought a Jan 2022 95C LEAP for 40 and during the dip the contract dropped to 29... Bought another. Average cost of 35 for 2 AAPL LEAPs. Already back up to 41.5, fuck yeah! 

Let's go AAPL!
Yep. Great news today. AAPL responds by shitting the bed
same! so far so good!
Loaded up on both after the correction ;)
Apple needs only a little push to go to $150.
When it gets officially confirmed, in earnings at the end of the month, it'll probably do something to the stock price.
It will definitely do something to the price... gonna drop
You know the deal
Earnings has been flat? Bruh did you miss the last quarterly earnings report? Their revenue went from 64 billion dollars to 111 billion dollars. I wouldnt exactly call that flat lol
Thats exactly what it did with the last earnings. Record breaking actually... and yeah, it still went down the next day
Wait for the professionals - I need minimum 32GB of RAM in my work, and looking to buy a 64GB ram Apple Sillicon Mac when it comes out. Insanity has barely begun!
it just clicks!
Reviews of M1 chips are super positive, they are way better than Intel chips. Considering this is their first chip, they will definitely make improvements in the future on an already astounding chip. Doesn't make sense to go for Intel which is kinda stagnating
It's a leap in performance for pros: video, image, audio edition.

Gamers are not going to switch to apple for obvious reasons but other users might migrate given the performance and battery life. The only thing holding massive adoption is apple prices.
You want find the same Price / Performance / Efficiency ratio on the market. It's possible desktops won't be so competitive (depending on scaling issues). Basically if you want a laptop it makes absolutely no sense to look at anything else then MacBook. Because of Intel no one can really compete. Dell (XPS), Microsoft (Surface) are compatible devices in the same price brackets and it doesn't make any sense to buy them. They can only cater to more price sensitive customers. If you want performance on the go Apple is the only company providing it.
Show me which laptop can match the M1 MBA for half the money (spolier: it doesn't exist)
From what I understood, originally the reason for the debit cards was to track the spending.  I think a lot made it into the stock market in May 2020, that's why they phased out the $1400 so quickly.  Instead of $0 stimulus at $190,001 it was lowered to $160,001 for married.  I guess the tracking will be made visable when the Q1 and Q2 numbers are reported.  Banks and Credit Cards deliquency reporting tells you people are more solvent.
That is called insider information and there is no way an apple exec is hinting at doing anything at some private party.  People speculate though.  Do some research on Martha Stewart.  I think conspiracy theories are getting the best of you.  I own 500 shares and bought around Sep - Oct 2020.  They are in 4 accounts and I'm up from 20-24%.  I'd say that's winning.
> a high-level executive at Apple just happens to hint at the company's plans 

As somebody in Cupertino who knows a ton of Apple employees, that would never happen. Never. They're more tight-lipped than the fucking pentagon. It's part of the culture.
Thank you. I’m just saying in general though . Will it go up without investors if the company is doing well ?
Apple Car, Apple TV, etc. when those rumors first hit investor chats, Apple bubbles up. When it hit blogs and news sites, it saw the decline. You scalp the rumors.
yeah man, they’re so dumb, i literally see those kind of people as sub humans, there’s no other way to describe it, you’re literally overpaying by A LOT, for something that’s worse, which isn’t even better or more enjoyable, something in their little brains has to be off.
Same, I averaged down right around early March but I ran out of funds. Thought about buying the m1 mac too but used it on stonks instead. Did not regret it.

Yeah, just a lil $200 billion  dollar push
66 billion to 74 billion on operating income.  Not flat, but 11% increase in profit vs 200% increase in stock price.
Yeah and look what happened to the stock price. It went from $145 to $135 the day after record breaking earnings
From what perspective? Apple's Enterprise support is bad enough that it doesn't matter if the chips are 3x as fast as a comparable Intel, companies who need comprehensive integrated device, security and identity management will simply never move to Apple products barring a major shift in Apples strategy.
Prices for sure, but also their Enterprise support and ecosystem is so bad that very few companies will use them.
No one is switching to Apple. The rise in Mac market share is due to stimulus and work from home requirements. At the 8% market share that is completely forgettable. The industry isn’t shifting to Apple or anything like that. The industry is set in stone with Windows.
Cloud gaming will kill gaming pcs in my opinion.
Price sensitive AND Enterprise. Enterprise is a much bigger deal than I think is getting attention for here.
He has a point about the vendor lock in situation. People with no tech knowledge at all likely won’t even consider that though
The price of a stock is always what investors are willing to pay for it, but it is ultimately tied to the quality of a company because it represents ownership of that company and a share in its profits. If investors collectively said that they don't want to own a company, regardless of how profitable it is, then the price can be $0 even if the company is doing well. But the chances of that happening are basically zero, because there's always investors looking for deals.
Valuation is based on purchases volume and price at the particular moment. If all buyers start offering 150 USD for the stock it is now a 150 USD stock even if only 10 billion  USD worth of shares were purchased that day.
Inflation should do it.
That's true, but there are 2 interpretations.

Yours is that they are severely overvalued now. Mine is that they were severely undervalued before :)
I remember it trading with a P/E ratio in the 30's last year too. How did the stock price double without P/E doubling if the price isn't tracking earnings?
Still not flat?
Everything tech went down...
You are right but those things are not set in stone, I mean, if they captured a good chunk of the pc market they would probably make things work, it would be in their own interest.
The rise in market share shows that people moved from wintel to mac, period. If the rise  is signalling a trend or is an outlier we will see, too. Many factors involved, the only objective point here is that the m1 gives mac users more performance per dollar and that closes the gap with windows platforms.
At some point cloud computing will eat up everything, games will be last because of latency I think.

 I'd like to know when this is going to happen. In the end it may be amazon creating their own hardware as they are going to be the main providers... Maybe I should start taking positions.
Well the company can do share buybacks if it hits $0 which would increase the price away from 0
Wrong, investors will absolutely buy shares in profitable companies.  To think they are going to blackball a company while it is profitable is never going to happen.  Stock prices are tied to forward earnings.  If in quarterly reporting a CEO say they are lowering guidance or they don't want to give guidance, those are negative sentiments.  The stock price will respond whether during trading, in premarket or in after hours.  On the other hand if they see a strong pipeline, they are going to report that as well and the price will corelate.  Cash is another one.  Apple is a cash cow.  Buy backs. Sometimes a company will buy back stock with its cash in a downturn because it props up the price.  Just as issuing stock dilutes it.  Now in a case like TSLA, he used 10% of his cash to buy #bitcoin.  #coin was at $40K then.  Look how fast that 10% cash grew.  That will come up in their next report.  I don't know that Apple is buying any but that would be a factor to watch.
They've had ample opportunity to try to capture this market and have shown absolutely no interest.  The cost of building out the types of infrastructural systems that Microsoft provides would be an astronomical investment and massive liability if they weren't able to gain at least like a 50% share of corp devices.  MS has been doing this (and doing it pretty damn well) for 30 years. I  just cannot see Apple playing the catchup game successfully here.

edit: I've worked in IT since 2001, this opinion is largely based on my professional experience.
Nvidia already started. Microsoft coming up. Google’s stadia started but doesn’t seem to compete with these names because of limited game selection I believe. I see Microsoft in good shape because they are the only ones could fire up millions of windows os in the cloud without paying a cent for licenses. They could literally offer the whole game archive of decades. They will be using their own cloud I assume. I never liked Microsoft’s products but I am thinking to go in because they are also second runner in the cloud. I am already in Amazon.
they already are making their own chips
So they don't want to, fair enough.
Amazon is a sure bet, they offer the final product to customers and it's not like amd or nvidia make their own chips, amazon could outsource chips to tsmc the same way. Nvidia at least owns arm.
That spells trouble for Intel, amd and nvidia...
TITLE: JP Morgan Chase beats profit estimates on strong trading, $5.2bln release of loan-loss reservesTEXT: Earnings: $4.50 per share vs. $3.10 per share expected by analysts polled by Refinitiv.
Revenue: $33.12 billion vs. $30.52 billion expected.

JPM, under Jamie Dimon, have become stalwart and constant earners, the BRK of banking if you will. They've shown resilience, are near riskless with their heavy participation in credit markets, and are extremely diversified, able to offset retail and commercial banking operations with trading and fixed income and vice versa. Could be the perfect long term hold for any investor.

https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/14/jpmorgan-jpm-earnings-q1-2021.html?__source=androidappshareCrazy that the god of value investing papa buffet just sold his ENTIRE position in jp
keep in mind that $1.72 of the earnings were a reversal of loan loss reserves.  extend and pretend is still alive and well - so be careful
You win some you loss some. I don't think Buffet will loss sleep on this one and the airlines. It is easy to judge his decisions with hindsight...

At the time, the US economy was facing unprecedented issue. The credit risk along with suppressed net interest margin was hurting the profitability in a fundamental way. And we wouldn't know for sure how committed the government was with the fiscal stimulus checks to pop up the economies. There's nothing wrong with him and team took the proactive measure to reduce perceived risk, and at the same time, they probably need to build up cash reverse for claims..

Congrats to Jamie and the team though
When CNBC touts a stock this hard you know it's about ~~risk less.~~ to tank.

Calling JPM "riskless" is absurd. Public companies aren't supposed to be riskless.

Edit: corrected wording
Lol and it's down half a percent.

This is one of my strongest holdings in the last six months.   It's performed very well.
Really impressive, even without the releas of the loan-loss reserves.
The buffet man pulling out makes this vewy vewy suspicious
Blah blah blah. So what’s the dividend increase gonna be?
if you listen to some of the prophets on youtube there are other reasons for it
This. Big red flags still be flying, folks.
Even still, it provides enough capital to produce sufficient future revenues and underlines Dimon's belief in either inflationary pressures (credit being a horrible sell, so transferring cash to other activities is a better idea) or an economic recovery (thus not requiring loan loss provisions)
>When CNBC touts a stock this hard you know it's about risk less.

It's an earnings release- they report this way for every single major stock. And those words are mine lol.

>Calling JPM "riskless" is absurd. Public companies aren't supposed to be riskless.

I meant riskless in relativity to other potential investments. JPMC quite literally has a fortress balance sheet, they've made themselves, via their credit activities (chiefly CDS') a vital aspect of the global economy, they've hedged themselves against inflation, hedged themselves against high volatility, etc. I don't see a scenario, asides from a complete global meltdown or fraudulent reporting, where JPMC fails.
Ok but they have like 100s of billions in idle cash so that last argument doesn't really apply. Perhaps they just made a mistake and its ok to admit it. They are dinosaurs at this point.
Who are these prophets?
If you hedge everything, your returns will drop to 1%-2%. Investment banks don't do this. JPM definitely has risk on their balance sheet - we just don't what it is. Look at Credit Suisse, I would have thought they were low risk until they lost $4.7b on Archegos.
schiff, gammon, michael invests
>If you hedge everything, your returns will drop to 1%-2%. Investment banks don't do this.

By hedge everything, I don't mean they've literally hedged everything.

I mean they're diversified enough to sustain any major swings in relation to larger economic events.

>Look at Credit Suisse, I would have thought they were low risk until they lost $4.7b on Archegos.

JPM and Credit Suisse are fundamentally different businesses targeting fundamentally different segments in fundamentally different markets. It's comparing apples to oranges.
> apples to oranges

But you can still compare them.
Alright, give me some substance and tell me how JPM and Credit Suisse face the same risks using their reports.

Suisse makes bank off of facilitating liquidity and trading activity through fees and whatnot, and the case with Archegos is a once in many years thing. 

Credit Suisse is a risk management firm first, JPM is a retail bank and credit manager first.
You lost me at "near riskless." You can say Guardian, Mass Mutual or some Credit Unions are near riskless. Public companies always have risk. That's their job.

Yes, JPM is a very well run company and different than Credit Suisse. But most people thought Citibank was a well run, diversified company in 2006. There's always risk. We don't know what we don't know.
TITLE: EU wants to ban use of AI for surveillanceTEXT: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-wants-ban-ai-surveillance-145317619.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/eu-wants-ban-ai-surveillance-145317619.html)

&#x200B;

This could effect TECH stocks a lot. Maybe in Asia and America it's okay that there is surveillance everywhere but not in Europe. This could possible effect some of the stocks.

Me as European i am happy.  I love tech stock but Europeans never support  **surveillance**

What you guys think about it? Temporary AI stocks fall?First it sounded nice but then 

> It said exceptions are allowed for public security reasons.

my police is shopping Hikvision systems and hardware and this doesn't prevent them from doing this?

Anyway, what is AI and what is just working algorithm?
Europeans never support surveillance?  That's funny, as London was one of the first major cities to install cameras virtually everywhere so as to monitor the public.
I want to ban drones for law enforcement.
Fines potentially up to 4%... If using AI saves them more than the fine, then guess what's going to happen... They will take that slap on the wrist all day long and just continue with business as usual, plus the fines become a tax write-off...

Also doesn't mean they won't just archive all the raw video footage or whatever, then when something happens they get a temporary approval to use AI and just run all the data then.

Not going to have any effect on tech.
Im curious who else would even use ai to surveil people? It seems like a pointless bill
But is London still European?
The uk kidna does its own thing sometimes
>  That's funny, as London was one of the first major cities to install cameras

Of which are no longer part of the European Union.

Did you miss brexit occuring or something?
Define surveillance, cuz you could argue just collecting data is surveillance..
That’s irrelevant
Geographically yes.

Politcally No.
Yeah.... Brexit... Let's say that's what I was referring to.
Ahh I didn't read your question as retorical...
