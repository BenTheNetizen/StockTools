If PLTR can hit 30$ EOW and AAPL finally hits 140 EOW it will be great.

Calling it now. Palantir's double click demo day is literally just a video of Alex Karp and Peter Thiel double teaming Mark Zuckerberg's wife. They finish and both look into the camera: "Palantir is the software of the future now. Bitch".

A: telling your parents you’re gay.
My boss told me today he bought AAPL in 2007, sold in 2010, and never touched it again.

You know what? I love some of you guys.
Q: how do you know someone is a PALANTARD?
A: don’t worry, they’ll tell you
I know a lot of y'all weren't here around this time last year so let me break it down for you.   Protests?   Civil unrest?  Rising covid cases and a vaccine being halted?    This is all...

#BULLISH

What are ya'll gonna do with your PLTR tendies?
Holding TSLA calls tonight...deep down I know it will go down tomorrow. But the 1% chance it moons. That 1% chance is worth it.
Veggie straws are better than they sound and look imho.

WSB when ARKK@150:  Man if only I could get an good entry point.

WSB when ARKK@110 twice:  Cathie is finished.
Crazy how much your mood throughout the day depends on how green your positions are.
There’s nothing more 2021 than pretend money with a dog on it singlehandedly redeeming my portfolio’s entire losses from March
I swear the market has become more retarded than us.
PLTR calls, AAPL calls, SPY calls all green I'm tits to the jacked and so fucking ready to get paid

NIO, PLTR, ASO. My boys.
PLTR double click day
PLTR $25 unreal. I got so many upvotes on PLTR forever $24 last week.
You fingered her, but before you could fuck, she ran out of time and had to go home. You both said you'd get a chance to fuck next time. But she got a boyfriend and your paths never cross again. 

*Me with the calls I fingered but never clicked buy on*
PLTR 30 pleaseeeeee
Did my first option contract today, and let’s say just say I’m hornier than a pack wolf who just tried cocaine for the first time
Nothing in trading compares to the euphoria of hitting significant all time highs in your account and the feeling of taking your ideas of what “a lot of money” is to the next level.

The shitty part is when you inevitably fall off those highs because of the natural volatility in options trading, any form of recovery that you would have once been stoked about seems insignificant compared to the gains you once had and your new expectation of “a lot of money”
If you’re hating on PLTR rn, you must be a retarded ape that is bagholding Blockbuster-tier stocks. Just gtfo smoothbrain.
Red days hurt a lot worse when you suck at your job
I think my 3yo is the alpha now. He just called me a son of a bitch.
is that pltr in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?
Tesla to 800 EOW

Tesla made more investing in a certain thing this year than they ever made selling electric cars. LOL Fucking Market is a joke
I made a good Buck off of sundial last week and decided to put it into a certain k9 currency. I am one happy shibe owner
Thinking about getting a job at Costco so I can invest more tendies, thoughts?
If PLTR is even close to 30 tomorrow sooo many people are gonna have a real tough decision on their calls.  Shit ton of money to be made.
Joined the 25k club today. Fuck the PDT rule
If you think this is the time to buy puts, remember some bears had the same idea last week. 

They are now all dead.
I’m a professional bagholder
Articles about how PLTR broke out of its bear pattern really making me nervous about my calls...
Next Tuesday will be the 1-year anniversary of when [WTI went negative](https://www.worldoil.com/news/2020/4/20/wti-crude-price-goes-negative-for-the-first-time-in-history). Fly your PPs at half-staff in remembrance of those who YOLO'd USO and for Tanker Gang.

I'm wondering if we're going to see a dip soon afterward with anybody who bought oil ETFs cashing out for long term gains.
PLTR APHA TSLA
Tlry and Apha yesterday was clearly a share shakeout. 18 the absolute lowest they can tank her. 

I think she hard bounces off the floor and rips to 35 now
AAPL gonna continue to rip until earnings isn’t it? That’s sexy beast.
If gme hits $40 again I'm loading up to the sky
I came home to the Fidelity “u r fuk” letter and my wife’s not here lol
My cock is hard as a brick rn thinking about tsla an pltr tomorrow
Never thought my unrealized loss on PLTR would be under $100 after being down thousands 

Not sure what to do, might buy high again idk
Words cannot begin to describe the boundless gratefulness I am feeling right now. I was born to 2 first-gen immigrant parents. We resided below the poverty line during my early years and as soon as they climbed out the recession hit and their house was foreclosed on. And now I YOLO’d my last $1000 into $SPY FDs. I lost most of it today without flinching, financial security unwavering. It has been an unbelievable privilege blowing up my account with you all for the fourth time. I will see you all again soon.

With eternal gratitude,

GUH
My smartest investment in the last 4 months was the dog coin. Damn.

Perhaps it was never about bulls or bears, but about dogs this whole time?
If tesla goes to $800 this week my semester is paid for. i need $2500 which i have but i have two calls that will more than pay for the semester if it hits
Well damn, looks like I need to replace my phone.  The screen is messed up, showing PLTR in green instead of the normal red.
Hello darkness, my old friend

So now all I have is...

Been at 200 shares in PLTR at $24 avg for awhile now. Nice to see green days but I will not sell this shit for another 5 years.
Even though I *know* COIN will be overvalued at the bell, and even though I *know* that most growth happens in the private market now. I’ll still probably fomo in, attempt to day trade, and end up losing
I initially created a Reddit to look at casual porn. Fast forward to now. I log on to Reddit to look at loss porn.

Alright boys I did some research. 

14 days is the most the SPY has ever been green in a row 

1971 was when that happened. It was Also the only time it went more than 12 days green. 

We are either on the 2nd best streak or greatest streak of all time
All this bleeding in Tesla for weeks all worked out today. Nothing feels better seeing options come back to life and selling and locking in profits. Good job TSLA gang
Dumping 5K into COIN tomorrow. Will double down once the hype fades and if it retains it's DPO support levels.
The higher we go, the more obvious a correction feels. 

But if it’s obvious, it won’t happen. 

So we will continue to go higher and higher and higher forever because it will keep becoming more obvious which means it won’t happen
Pltr to the moon
Watching small cap tech die has felt like a 2 month prostate exam
AAPL about to tear bears asshole off the rest of this week

Anybody holding Tesla calls overnight?
On PLTR: I know the past doesn’t guarantee the future, but on the last demo day it was green demo day and the day after. With the current hype, I see no reason it shouldn’t go up at least a little more, even if it’s nothing like the massive spike from last time. Too many people think it’s over and it’s not even demo day...
Imagine using 'imagine' as a rhetorical device

I bought like 3 TSLA 750 calls this morning, because that's all I can afford with my life's worth. Went back to work flipping burgers all day. My account went from 1500 to 6000. I was really sad the last few weeks but I'm actually feeling content now.
If pltr hits 40 tomorrow I will finally take my dog out of the microwave

AAPL gang, what’s the move
People be talking about green days like they're closing higher than they opened. But isn't the traditional definition of a green day closing higher than it closed the previous day? Seems like people are redefining common terms around here.

TITLE: WSB loves Gain / Loss / YOLO posts. Rule Review.TEXT: WSB is all about making high risk, high reward plays. We organize these with the [Gain](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AGain), [Loss](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3ALoss), and [YOLO](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?sort=new&restrict_sr=on&q=flair%3AYOLO) flairs.

With so many new faces, it's important that we highlight what it means to make a good thread with these flairs.

# Gain / Loss Minimums

**Options Threshold:** $2,500 USD

**Shares Threshold:** $10,000 USD

---

# YOLO Minimums

**Options Threshold:** $10,000 USD

**Shares Threshold:** $25,000 USD

# Posting Guidelines:

The first image should include all the information about your trade, such as:

* Stock name

* Number of shares / contracts

* Total invested amount

* Profit / Loss

* Strike(s) and/or Expiry Date (if applicable)

Other images are optional. People love seeing all time graphs, so include that where possible. 

When your positions exceed a single screenshot, place the largest one first.

**Leave a comment with why you entered the trades that you did.** This is usually more interesting than the gain / loss porn itself. You took the risk and put your money where your mouth is, tell us why.

---

##*Important!* 

* Your gain or loss *must* be realized, or about to expire (<1 day) before you can post. If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close. (**YOLO threads are exempt from this**)

* Be timely with your posts, if you have a big gain, loss, or YOLO, post it right away. No one wants to see a bet you made months ago.

* The minimum applies to any amount you hold **in a single company**, so three $1K losses on TSLA puts at different strikes/expiries is allowed, but a $1K loss on TSLA, PLTR, and AAPL puts is not. That's called diversification, and diversification is for pussies.

We're not suggesting you close your current positions, but we want to make sure that the threads that are being posted are interesting and meaningful. As they say, it's not a loss until you sell... right?!

>We're not suggesting you close your current positions

Guys close your positions. Money is ??? but reddit karma is sweet sweet lifeblood.
I love you for this it's definitely going to clear all that clutter of paper losses that's not expiring for a while, and post that aren't even remotely a YOLO play. I mostly just hid the post but nice to see some change.
Thank u god. Hope this clears up the cancer of trash posts we’ve seen the last few months. Nobody cares about these broke boys with their 5 shares of GME or AMC.
I think everyone’s first gain/loss/yolo *needs* to be options. Shares are boring. I wanna see some ten or twenty baggers people.
TLDR: Don't post loss porn if you're poor. Also have you tried not being poor?
YES STOP POSTING SHIT POORS !!!
U MAKE ME
SICK !!
What about updates on yolo's - I get that dfv rightly can swing his dick but now you have dweebs posting about their gradual accumulation of amc or some other dwarf account. Get that shit outta here, I don't give a fuck about your retirement fund.

"i WiLl bUy gAMesToP"..... 





Cunts
But my BB shares are up $10 today
I wish *share* YOLOs weren't even allowed. I don't understand the point of them. It's not risky and millions of people do it every day. No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. We don't need posts of people just buying shares. They're most likely the same shares everyone else has lol. Remove them and only allow share loss/gain posts. Those are the only things people care about. Only allowing share loss/gain posts knocks 2 birds out with 1 stone. It shows the YOLO and the loss/gain.
There should be a percentage of account requirement or something. Someone with a $1m account throwing $25K in shares of something isn't a YOLO; someone with a 5K margin account throwing 9K in OTM options expiring the next day is a YOLO
Would be nice to ban shares from these completely but this is a wonderful step in the right direction
One minor gripe I have is the billion dollar market cap rule. There's companies that sit around that cap or under it and break the rule but are legit YOLO plays. I mean hell if risk is the spice of this kitchen a sub billion market cap is higher risk than a mega cap or w/e.

Not advocating pennystocks or anything like that and don't think DD should necessarily be allowed on cap<1B but the spirit of a YOLO is maximum retard at its most spectacular.
Please enforce these rules. Ready for WSB to get back to normal pre GME era
#Yeeesssssss
I think the mods should consider decreasing minimum for YOLO if it’s expiring on same week. 

Not sure how feasible that is to enforce just a suggestion. I have seen a lot 400-1000 weeklies turn to 30k+ on here.
The rules we need, but not the ones we deserve. 

It's almost like OIP knows what he's doing!
Been here since the first GME squeeze in Jan and I’ve loved every minute, here to stay and I cannot wait to lose more money with you all!
I just posted a yolo, but the mod wouldn’t accept just the ArkX options.  So I had to post a screenshot of other holdings so it would accept.  It wasn’t ideal
#*jack nicholson head nodding gif*
>Your gain or loss **must** be realized, or about to expire (<1 day) before you can post. If it's good enough to screenshot, it's good enough to close.

I like this idea! but I feel like no one follows this rule, and will continue to not, lol. Especially because once you close your position, it’s usually less obvious from a given screenshot what the return was from that specific security.
I’m glad we are revisiting this, solid improvements needed for our sub now
Yessss losing over 10k means I make the threshold wooohooo
we love to see NIO yolos!
 That's called diversification, and diversification is for pussies. 

So I take more loan yes
Dude check out my .0007 stock in GME! I'm to the moon baby!
“Diversifying”
Why do you guys use such big words all the time?
Why is there such a low options gain minimum? Like if I make a 10K yolo and gain 2.5K that’s pussy shit IMO
Gain minimums might need to be updated to 500k when/if GME moons
New phone, who dis?
GME without AMC support makes both of us less strong. Let's change that within subs, soldiers
Well if someone kills it this is saying you can’t post if you ever hold term? Some people like to take cost basis it and let it ride?  Otherwise sounds good. My 2 cents
wait so its too late to post my 10k loss from SPY weekly straddles in December? (also what has been up with trades from months ago showing up now)
Tell that to my ex wife
Diversifi-who-what?
That is actually what Buffet and Munger say basically
So we shouldn't diversify our losses?
yes, sound advice for r/investing. not for r/wallstreetbets...peep the last word (ill give you a hint: BETS)
cobra kai!
Yup, been seeing a lot of "loss porn" on LEAPS. Unless if they're planning on selling them at -75% 8 months out from expiration then I guess they belong here.
I'm tired of seeing the gme options posts from February and January. I know gme kinda sucks right now for gain porn but that's just karma farming
I want to see more options at 0.01
Nah shares can be good but I think the thresholds should be significantly higher. Like $100k+ gain/loss for shares and maybe $500k/$1mm for a share YOLO
Ease off the cocaine, brosef
> "i WiLl bUy gAMesToP".....

The "I will own Gamestop" guy is pretty legit though
I don't really like share YOLOs either, especially for larger stocks, however, there have been some interesting share YOLOs on stocks that don't usually get discussed, like PRPL or PINS. Another example of where they would make sense is in biotech companies with binary events.

One solution could be to raise the limit to $50K or $100K (and as the sub grows, this becomes more feasible) -- but we've already just raised it from $10K to $25K, so it may be better to take it slow for now.

That said, if the position is big enough, then no matter which way the stock moves, a sufficiently large share YOLO would qualify for the gain/loss flair.
I don't mind them personally, I'm skilled enough to lose *a lot* of money with just shares in a very short period of time. It is kind of boring when they buy something with no volatility though.
Shares of 3X leveraged ETFs should be allowed. I wanna see those.
> No one gives a shit you bought $25k of AAPL. 

And posts like that would be rightfully downvoted. Still though it's fun to see people yeet tens of thousands at a stock I never heard of, or a company that's super volatile during earnings, or at risk of going bankrupt.
We were also all bitching in August when everything was a TSLA YOLO and those were options. 

As much as I hate seeing the same shit now we do go through that, and if the rules are *too* limiting we might have a feed that gets really boring.


^(I’ll never bitch about TSLA again)
Share YOLO’s shouldn’t be allowed at all.
I mean personally haven't yolo'd. For shares I'd ban shares on blue chip companies. For contracts idc
share yolos on penny or meme stonks can be very interesting! but those were someone bought a million in nio back in november 2020 for example
Lol as if 25k in aapl can be even considered a yolo. Thats about as safe of investment someone can make except spy. Put another way i wouldnt even blink or lose any sleep over that much in aapl (in fact i bought twice that much in the last few weeks and thats just one of my holdings, and im one of the most risk averse people youll ever meet). 

A true yolo should be you and your children will literally be on the streets if the trade goes south.
The solution to that would be to just not have share YOLO posts. Only allow the gain/loss post. Literally the solution to all the issues with share posts is to only allow gain/loss posts.
It's a slippery slope to P&D posts
Probably would be really hard to keep track and then looking back over time. At this point someone at least could make it an impressive gain
That was the beginning of the end of this sub lol
She understands how diversifying the men she sleeps with is important though
Hahaha
Between your dick, her boyfriend's dick, and mine, her pussy was certainty for diversification
Di-worse-ification
He mean divorce with your money
True! Though “diversification is for pussies” sounds much better than Munger’s “diworseification”
I do. As soon as I start to lose I jump to something else and lose there too
Half of this sub is sick of GME at this point
Puts are printing, still gain porn material.
I think he and DFV are the only two who should get to swing their dicks around.
I'm biased because based on their last update I'm holding more shares than them, but I only care to see yolo updates in the format of adding a buy-in that meets the current rule requirements, unrealized gains that are double or more, or unrealized losses that are half or more.
Share yolos should be your entire account or net worth or at least a very significant and impactful portion
Share and option YOLOs should be text posts with the YOLO screenshot. The text should contain the reasoning behind. This would be more powerful than some questionable DDs. 

Also, aren't we here exchanging ideas for future gain? Gain/loss porn look at the past. YOLOs look at the future.
With share YOLOs the gain/loss is going to be minimal. Most shares fluctuate like 1-5% each day. So even at $100k the loss is going to be minimal and boring and not even worthy of a loss/gain post. So what's the point of allowing the YOLO post if the loss/gain is going to be minimal? If it was me, I'd set the minimum at 250k since a daily drop/gain could actually be a lot.
what if maybe the circumstances behind the yolo justify it? for example, lets say someone pulled a personal loan for 25k, and Yolos on some stock on full margin. ya shares are lame, but I think the double trouble money borrowing would make it just retarded enough to fit the nature of this sub. not like I'm doing this right now obviously so don't ask me about it.  baka.
ban blue chip shares ?
>  I wanna see those.

Yeah, the gain/loss posts. Just posting that you bought it isn't that intersting.
SOXL anyone???
> And posts like that would be rightfully downvoted.

And so should posts about AMC or whatever flavor of the week it is. No one really cares unless you gain or lose. What is the take-away from someone posting they bought 25k of AMC? What is there to discuss? Nothing. You're 1 of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people who are doing the same thing. It's not special.
But if there's a massive threshold like 10k on it I can't see the problem. Tis but a dream
That's why I told these mods two months ago to only restrict posting to those who subbed to WSB before the GME craze. But let everyone else comment. That would have cleared up the quality of posts without shutting down gme. But of course the mods didn't take heed, I mean what else do you expect from a bunch of cucks lmao
Sub is unusable since GME started its run, it was fun for a while but man, it’s boring seeing the same shit memes copy pasted over and over.

Still waiting for it to hit $100k a share though, which I’m told was a guarantee basically.
Today one of those days where both calls and puts were both red across the board, almost all were double-digit too lol
I wanna helicopter it up too
It's hard to communicate "you can post YOLOs but only above a certain investment amount but below a certain market cap", I wouldn't blame anyone for being confused. 

And what would you allow from large market caps? Would you include AMD? ($100B) How about TSLA? ($750B)
Agree. That’s what I mean.
> What is the take-away from someone posting they bought 25k of AMC?

The fact that its hugely volatile?

I'm tired of the meme stocks too and most of the people they brought with them. Nature will heal. Doesn't mean we need to ban share posts outright.
Gay mods r gay :/
Hey u/memetron9000 you gonna let this guy talk about you like this?
There's still some funny shit. The paper trading competition thread was keeping me entertained for hours
Nah you can still dig up some good DD if you look hard
If you were quick you could have made quite a bit with it fluctuating to that 132 low. Not a lot of liquidity though at the moment, very low volume.
I see your point. Ye nvm
> The fact that its hugely volatile?

Which is what the gain/loss posts are for. See what I mean? No one really cares about your volatile stock until something happens.
Guh
TITLE: GME - It's all coming togetherTEXT: Apes, I come to you as a fellow primate with excellent news: my wife finally left me. Now I have her boyfriend all to myself.

Before I reading, I just want to express that predictions and dates should not be taken as absolute and that these are just my opinions on what COULD be coming. I am also well aware that correlation does not equal causation and that these correlations could be coincidences, so please don't comment that, these are just my thoughts based on research that I've done. I've done many posts on GME and these are all my personal opinions based on my research, so do not take them as fact. This is not financial advice, I am not a financial advisor.

There's been an onslaught of news regarding GME in the past few weeks and days, and I believe that there is more to come and that because of that the squeeze is inevitable and in the near future.

**The news:**

\- Amazon + Chewey Execs being appointed

\- RC being named god of the board

\- GME announcing the search for new C.E.O.

\- GME paying off senior notes (today)

\- The announcement of GME's right/intention to sell 3.5M shares or $1B in value (this may not seem important but I'll explain why it's crucial later)

\- The announcement of the definitive date for the annual meeting (6/9 lmao)

**Why it matters:**

The past two weeks have been bombarded with news from GME, and almost all of it deals with leadership or the transformation. I believe that this bombardment of news is extremely intentional. The reason that I believe this is because of their announcement of the right to sell those shares. When GME made this announcement, the stock was at $190. GME knew full and well that anytime an announcement like this happens, the market would react negatively to the stock, and, because GME is so volatile and the victim of abusive shorting, that negative reaction could've been huge. Despite knowing this, they decided not to sell at that moment. I deduce from that lack of action that GME believes that the stock will go WELL ABOVE that $190 level sometime in the future because if they really wanted to capture the value of the stock at $190, they would've just sold the shares instead of reserving the right to do so. With that being said, I believe that they are actively trying to set up the stock for a massive run that could potentially trigger a squeeze so that they can capitalize on a price that is well above $190. If this wasn't their plan, then it made zero sense that they didn't just sell at $190 knowing that the announcement would tank the stock, which it did. Finally, when almost every analyst (boomers) says that GME is grossly overvalued, it is irresponsible of you as a corporation not to take advantage of that extremely elevated share price unless.... you have reason to believe that it will soon be substantially higher. Therefore, I believe that the recent slew of announcements is their attempt to make that happen and that we should see more announcements in the near future because they are probably well aware that being lax about this could lead to decreased interest in the stock.

To add to this, GME has repeatedly warned in their S.E.C. filings that suspect shorting activity on the stock could cause it to squeeze (they have said this twice since the original squeeze). This, to me, seems that they are covering themselves so that they can't get sued for market manipulation if it does indeed squeeze. What's even more interesting about this is that maybe they have data that is not available to apes and other primates that suggests that the shorting activity is even more abusive than any of us thought (again just a theory).

**Catalyst**

But what could the next announcement be? It's very difficult to actually know. The paying off of the senior notes caught me by surprise but isn't news that would actually propel the stock to the stratosphere. I believe that their next catalyst will be something about either the C.E.O. position or the digital transformation. GME could very well announce Cohen as the C.E.O., which would undoubtedly send the stock to the stratosphere. They could also announce something about an acquisition or something related to their shift to e-commerce. Again, this is simply conjecture, but I believe that GME is going to make some kind of catalyst announcement soon to push up the price. However, the biggest and most crucial catalyst could be a share recall. First, I want to stress that GME itself cannot recall shares, only individual investors can do that. If only there was an investor with a ton of shares in GME who has an active interest in making the stock go higher and has tweeted cryptic messages about hating shorts and bears... oh wait. If Cohen or another whale with a high stake in GME announces a share recall, that could be the ultimate catalyst for us. Or, if the hiring of a new executive/board member requires a vote, an activist could do what Hestia did last year and recommend that all shareholders recall their shares (see my previous DD on that).

Personally, I thought that the Cohen news would propel us to the moon, but I guess not. Maybe that shows more proof that shorts are in really deep. 

**Timing**

The timing on the possible above-mentioned catalyst could not be more perfect. First, our lord and savior Mr. Gill's calls expire this Friday. At the same time, GME is forming what many are calling the mother of all wedges on extremely low volume (pictured below). The apex of the wedge should be this Thursday or Friday but could get pushed back to sometime next week if we still trade sideways. As many of you know, the options volume for this Friday is also through the roof as most of GME's monthly options are. What I'm hoping for is that GME announces some kind of catalyst in the coming week that will make a whale who is not invested in GME think "wow the stock is consolidating in this giant wedge pattern and is relatively cheap... time for some chaos." Finally, we have the 4/20 (lmao) deadline for shares to be recalled ahead of the annual meeting. I have trouble believing that GME is not going to do something before that deadline to trigger a price jump because, as I said previously, they have a vested interest in getting this above $190.

Here's the mother of all wedges that is actually forming with the mother of all cup and handles (yeah I know the cup and handle might be a stretch):

&#x200B;

Finally, I also said in a previous post that GME is correlated extremely closely to the VIX. Many have said that it is inversely correlated with SPY, which seems to be true, but it is even more directly correlated with the VIX. This leads me to believe that GME does not move when the market is bad, but GME moves when the market is volatile (which usually happens when the market is bad). And, oh would you look at that, SPY is at $412 and is overbought and the VIX is at $16 (pre-pandemic levels). Looks like the market is thirsty for some nice volatility. For more on this, I encourage you to read "the everything short" post, which provides a much more in-depth analysis of how the market could crash and how GME relates to that.

Here are the charts. The first one is VIX and the second is SPY (both are the purple lines), as you can see, the VIX lines up extremely similarly with GME and SPY seems to be inverse to GME. This shows that GME does best when conditions are volatile or that GME creates volatile market conditions. As stated previously, the market is very overbought right now and there is very little volatility, so GME may soon be primed to change that or benefit from a change. The thing to get from this is that, based on GME's relationship to SPY and VIX, this is another indication that GME is in the perfect position to have a breakout as SPY is overbought and VIX is extremely low:

**Quick Note on Short interest**  

Just wanted to give my thoughts on the GME short interest. As you all know there are tons of different numbers on GME short interest. Most boomer websites say it's anywhere between 19%-50% which is still extremely high. Most apes say that it's over 100% at minimum. I personally believe that websites are correct because the data is being altered through ETF shorting, naked shorting, and synthetic longs (see other posts for more on this). Therefore, I believe that the true short interest is over 100%. It makes no sense that GME's borrow rate on iborrowdesk is below 2% with short interest being able 20% and available shares getting to below 100 at one point today. Also, based purely on logic, it doesn't make sense that if every boomer analyst thinks GME is grossly overvalued that they wouldn't short it, so there is no way that GME's short interest is anything below 50%. Therefore, I believe that they are indeed abusively shorting it but are using the above tactics in order to manipulate the data so that the true short interest isn't shown so that regulators and the media don't start getting suspicious. 

**Conclusion**

So, we have technicals lining up very nicely, a company with a vested interest in seeing the stock soar right now, a plethora of potential catalysts, a definitive date for when shares would need to be recalled, abusive shorting, a failure to deliver cycle, an insanely volatile stock that loves good news, a market that is thirsty for some volatility, and oh year one more thing.... some damn primates that refuse to sell. Stay strong, apes.finally I saw a triangle today! This is a relief !
Great read, really appreciate it dude
Literally gave away a silver to a guy in the daily gme thread but should’ve given to you. May have to recall it but I’m sure it’s been lent out to 25 other users now and shorted to shit
Needed to see this, STAY STRONG EVERYONE..

SHORTS HAVE TO COVER, ITS COMING..
So buy more? Got it
Crazy that everything that seems to be a great direction for literally any other company, the price would sky rocket. 

Painting a clear picture of the possible turn around and it tanks. And nobody’s downgrade their bullshit price targets? Haha haha. I’m laughing all the way to the bank
Let's get that dividend boyyyyssss. Make the hedgies pay us
My naughty parts are tingling
All the ol big nuts and shriveled dick curve.
the more I think about it, this isn't just class warfare but also generational to some extent as well. Millennials vs Boomers (and some other generations mixed around too)
Nice DD..... made my little PP bounce
BOOM
I just read this wall of DD and turned into Hammy (from Over the Hedge) and yelled, "Let's call it Steve."  :-)   And then my thankful self turned into Ozzie and said, "Oh, great and powerful Steve!"  :-)
Fly me to the moon  
Let me play up there with those stars  
Let me see what life is like  
On a-Jupiter and Mars  
In other words, hold my hand  
In other words, darling, kiss me
A double triangle! Its almost a triple triangle!!!
There’s one thing wrong with your post, there hasn’t been a single squeeze yet. The run up to 450s was due to supply and demand.
Welp. Wether it happens tomorrow or this time next year I'm holding untill then. 
Everything else is just speculation and distraction. 
I just set price alerts, go about my day at my shitty back breaking job, and make sure my bills are payed. 
If I have some other Xtra "scratch" I buy some more. 
This is inevitable. But it could take some time. 
Everyone needs to realize that alot of big players don't want the little players to win. 
Hold/buy more when it dips and you will be rich. 
Don't put a fucking timeline on it man..
I like your DD, I would like to add a possible big news announcement could also be a return of dividends.

Can we be sure that GameStop hasn't sold any of its 3.5 million shares though? I'm not sure when we would find out if they did choose to sell them.

I see a lot of hate for IBD around here and I'm not sure why. If an ape smarter than me could explain why it's good/bad source I would definitely like to know.
Read title in Kronk's voice
Jesus you guys are an army
TL;DR: stock most likely going up, but it could go sideways or down first. Hold til Valhalla.
My mom is coming to get me
Thank you uncle Hanky for the confirmation bias
OP you're confusing me... you said "  I personally believe that websites are correct " regarding short interest
Share. Recall. That’s the mother of all catalysts. We need it. Now.
Several sentiment catalysts of value, but two things specifically.  Having been a Sr Exec in TWO public companies, of course the Chairman, CEO, and board members know for a fact more info on SI than is public.  I also no longer believe in coincidences. 

You apes may call me a boomer, at the end of that generation, but I like the stock and I like the happenings, having been there.

Catalysts indeed.  350 strong at an average of approx $63 in my second buy after I sold at $101 in March on the way down, bought in again at $42.44 and averaged up to that magical $63. Following closely after reading some DD here and doing some of my own.  I wanted to buy again at $136 this morning. And should have but didn't for whatever assanine reason. CHWY has also been good to me, in early because my wife buys there all the time for our two pups (that said we also buy local from our long time vet).  Local is also good. Especially now with all the bullshit we have been dealing with for far too long.

I'm gonna just hold and watch.  Good luck to all of us.
I’m not a financial advisor but if I was I would say wait for the squeeze and don’t sell until it starts going down. Wish I could read OP - Sent From My iPhone
Holding. Buying the dip. Got it Champ.
This is a good summary. Thanks!
GME ready to go full Phineas for real this time
When this all comes together, we'll all be $CUMming together
Could one bet on vix to crash as gme rises?
It looks like a ladle not a cup are ladles a thing in the chart world?
Fuck yeah look at that triangle
I don’t think it’s a cup and handle pattern but u are right it’s definitely a wedge
Sorry if this has been answered before but who has the authority to margin call citidal? . Who lent them their money ?
Great recap! Thank you!
Im pretty sure a company can’t outright sell 3.5million shares without announcing it beforehand.

Just like that rule when you own like 5% of a company if u intend to sell your position you have to notify that you will. 

But the fact they didn’t might be beneficial.
u/HomeDepotHank69

Not only do they have a vested interest in getting it over 190, but over 285! Maximum of 3.5M shares at a maximum of 1B dollars. Every cent over 285.71 is fewer shares they have to sell.
Cup and handle, or swimming pool with hottub in this case.
Holy Madonna tits that is a triangle!
Did I just find an actually good GME DD? no way

Edit: obligatory crayon drawing comment
10 mil per share or bust
You’re using what looks to be Microsoft Paint... on a linear chart....

Switch to Log chart. Use a site or program that has built in tools for TA.

Every single upwards support line you can draw has been invalidated, or it’s far far below where price is now. Price has also fallen below 20 & 50 day MAs. There is 0 bullish case to be made here. 

TA wise, the only thing that stands out on this chart is an Adam and Eve double top. With a dead cat bounce already sprinkled in.

Just the confirmation bias I was looking for.
 Apes, I come to you as a fellow primate with excellent news: my wife finally left me. Now I have her boyfriend all to myself. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

PROFF OR FUCKING BAN
This is the bias I come for.  Came twice from your first 2 sentences.
Spice cakes!!!
Forgot about being paid in shares
Bullish still.


YEAH BABY THIS IS THE WAY
what is this "sell" I keep seeing in the o.p?
Good news I almost pissed on my balls.
Something about tits
Ape buy
Bought more today right before the news.  Averaging down from 300 has been rough but should be at a gain after this week with all this news!  Can’t wait for the new CEO announcement!
This ape needs his confirmation bias-nanas
This is why I'm losing my mind. 

*runs around knocking on doors* 

"The Tendies are coming! The Tendies are coming!"
This is a lot of words
DFV becomes a GME activist investor that recommends via social media and written letter that all shareholders recall their shares, let’s goooo
They sold stock already look their outstanding stock last week it was 67.95 now it’s 70.03 from that money they paid off debts
I can’t wait to dress like Yung Gravy
Is it weird that i nutted reading this ?
You had me at correlation does Not prove causation.  There might be a wrinkle in that brain of yours.  Nice  report.
I just got so excited I threw my poo against the wall.
[insert Charlie Kelly in mailroom meme]
I love Hank
You should call your mom.
can we get a SHEEESH train?!!!
This is an honest, and serious question. In your first paragraph, you mention the stock offering. What if they did offer, and no one took them up on it. If all the analysts say the stock is only worth 12-25 a share, why in the world would anyone buy it at 190?
^What he said^
Keep dreaming LMFAO 

Congrats on holding a stock that's never going to spike like you all want
I'm wondering if those 3.5 million shares are close to the short? Could gme sell those to allow shorts to cover which wouldn't leave much for us if we can't find a buyer? Seems like it would track the stock and support of they did that....
Imagine thinking GME is still going to the moon despite the fact that's been steadily declining for a month now.
The reason the borrowing rate percengage doesn’t make sense is because you don’t want it to make sense. The data in front of your eyes is correct and you choose not to believe it and make these elaborate excuses to justify it. The shorts have covered, that’s it.
Confirmation Bias just delivers that dopamine oh so good, time to buy more tomorrow
I've been wondering since January when GME first squeezed up if Gamestop or any publicly traded company is able to hire a private investigator or maybe hire a hedge firm to get access to information about what shorters are really doing to their stock price. I know that GME has insider information about the company but do they have more accurate information about how really bad the shorting is.
Bias confirmed. Hold. Gotcha
Is the thought that GME didn't sell the 3.5MM shares when they could, or that they're going to use those shares to pay the new Board members those shares in the 100% equity they're receiving?
IS WALLSTREET BEATS JUST ABOUT GME?
Obviously sooner is better but I hope it happens after I get paid on Friday otherwise I'm overdrawing my bank account to buy on Thursday
I'm sorry, can someone tldr, does this mean buy or don't rn
.
Thank god for triangles!
I'm using GME to hedge against these losses I'm taking in the EV sector.

Not selling a single fucking share. My thesis is still in tact I'm holding.
I miss the DD where it was an Ape. We’re stronk togetherness
Dunno what all this means, but

I just want to make more money to throw at apes with boobies.
Hmmm, speeding ticket,or GME? I'm legit torn lol
So my thoughts is that the hedge funds know that this Friday could be the catalyst. As such they will short everything they can including perhaps a 28 million dollar apartment they just sold. All I am saying is get ready for some easy dip buys on Friday.
So do I have time to move the other half of my GME to my TFSA or what
So... you’re saying I should buy puts on VIX?  The market always moves against my trades, so a put should trigger MOASS.
so buy GME and VIX?
You've just peaked an interest from my husband's girlfriend...
You deduce huh?
Nice DD. This is the way!
Was a proxy statement released saying that the 20th was the deadline to recall shares and register to vote in the upcoming shareholders meeting? 

I subscribe to GME emails and haven't seen this yet...
Man i cant read well but i read "this is financial advice please take it serious and plan accordingly ".
Guess ill hold
link to 'everything short' post pls?
Lines and colors pretty. Makes me want to buy more GME.
Hmmm, needs more triangles
wow you can connect those 3 points into a triangle?  what are the chances of that??!!??
What's the estimated quantity threshold to declare intention to recall shares and be successful?

If multiple individuals independently decide to exercise this course,  does it solidify the recall more than one individual? 

Asking for some Cetaceans.... uh friends.

u/JuxtaposeLife do you know the details on this?

GME to buy Valve, that'll do it
Been waiting weeks for a triangle like that. Goddamn I can break out the 96 pack crayons in peace again
I haven’t had a boner since March, and you just brought it back. I’ll leave you all the shares I’m gonna buy tomorrow in my will
The Cohen CEO news will not propel the stock, he’s currently that persons fucking boss and it didn’t do dick. Why would the CEO title matter more than the person the CEO answers to?? I know I’m dumb but that makes zero fucking sense. Believe me I’m holding and will continue to, but that line of thought is dumb by even my standards. Only thing launching this are those DTCC laws and the new SEC leader and margin calling
I like the DD!
Hey I've seen this post before
Always look forward to your crazy DD’s Hank. My 4/16 calls would love a squeeze this week but I’m sure I’ll have to wait haha.
Im just holding.
A wiggly lined triangle is what GME needed this whole time
I love seeing posts that summarize all the awesome announcements that have been coming out of GME! Confirmation bias confirmed!
Chaos is a ladder.
Yay ... we all Coming together. Group hug in the shower!
Yes. I love triangles!
So....all those words and I just got: hold....

me. smart. ape.
I see triangles
Here's whats gonna happen on 6/9

"Breaking news! Ryan Cohen is now gamestop's ceo, and gamestop just bought amazon! The stock just hit 1 trillion!"
MELVIN: KNEES

IN MY HAND: KEYS(LAMBO)

GME: SQUEEZE

PAPERHAND: &%$#@ PLEASE!!!
I see a lot of beautiful charts! This must be true!
I rate this DD a 36DD out of 10
Holy moly! I'm very surprised there's still a ton of love for GME on WSB. For the past few weeks, as soon as I mention GME and/or apes, I would get downvoted, yelled at, called out like hell. 

To the moon we go GME!!!
Don’t worry bois, I bought 2 shares today. The whale has breached.
Pro tip: Save taxes by investing your 401k in GME!
All we need to know is the 4/20 and 6/9 dates. That is communicating that they understand the power of MEMES. Cohen reads these reddit threads too. Share recall = catalyst, hedgefunds destroyed.
AMC banana ape man here. You gme apes good apes. Find big dipper banana plan. Good news for gme ape. AMC ape no care about news. We ape only know three things: but banana, hold banana, and napping in sun on banana pile.
This feeds my confirmation bias which i barely understand so i will just say me keep hold bc post make me feel good
New market indicator for big upward mooning, soup ladle
But but but but MUH ANALYSTS... they say red red no thinky big for yourself. 

In other words ape to analyst..... ape buy more?
Still, thats one big flag for ape to climb with banana
Cool, so possibly another month of manipulation then?
I went all GME in this marketwatch game for school so I hope it goes up so I can claim whatever my teacher said the prize was when the game ends
Holy shit this is actually good DD.
Bought five more today... up to a whopping eleven shares.  Its honest ~~work~~ gambing.
Have you ever considered the timing of the short attacks and why HF choose to short at this time?
So sell now so we can buy high later? Got it
woof
It’s sad
So, will the primary residence be in Waikiki or on the north shore?  Definitely getting one of those new electric hummers tho.  Banana colored.
OMG, the new CEO is going to be Bezos!! That's why he retired from Amazon, because he knows GME has even more potential!
So if flags are just flags on trend, as in its a bull flag on an upward trend, and a bear flag on a downward trend And the 400$ prices are  behind us, and the second spike was a lower price. Doesn't that mean your crayons are telling you this will break out but a downward break out? 

If anyone believes the magic crayon lines there has to be someone warning the people of potential bad times.
You convinced me, [$190 prediction it is.](https://www.factionfinancial.com/prediction/30ff9eab-4477-47c7-8457-2aee19e86609)

420 Blaze it boys!
$1B/3.5Ms=$285.71

I see that as the minimum price target before they start releasing shares little by little.
I've been hearing for 2 months now that it's all coming together. I hope it does soon.
Kind of a triangle IN a triangle!  A Duoriangle?
You have doubts?
I learned in grade school that triangle is the strongest shape. ape hold
Yep, triangle on the thumbnail = instant upvote
Any concern that the vertices weren't touching?
Proud I was able to get through all of it without dosing off
Recall it, it is now worth 1000 Silvers!
Tomorrow on Motley Fool: forget GME, Reddit is shorting $SLV
sorry, you can only recall time from a Bulgarian boy
I know a guy you can call who knows a guy who knows where to locate more .
The silver squeeze will squoze!
me too
Yeah I wonder where they will find the shares to cover?  It's not like the company will just make brand new shares to sell to them!

Oh, wait...
the questions thats bugging me, how many banks are in on this???
ItS alReADy PrICeD In!!!
The company doesn't need the share price to rise at any particular time. They've got enough cash rolling in from the current console cycle to sit on the share offering for as long as it takes. They're simply bullish on the transition to the future GME and know that the shares will be above $280 eventually, whether it's next week or next year doesn't matter.

The short interest discussion is completely absurd. Your assumption that boomers have to be shorting because they're boomers is dumb. Boomers may be bearish but they're also scared shitless when they see others getting castrated on their shorts. And the manipulation has been proceeding unabated for this long, what will stop it from continuing? I see no reason to believe short interest has come down, nor to dismiss 20% short as not that high.
Banks are broken, we don't use banks anymore.
I doubled my stake today. I have two shares now.
Stop staring through my window please.
confirmation biased confirmed  cause my balls and dick looks like this
Gen-X is heavily invested in this. We grew up on GameStop. EB Games, Babbages, and Funcoland. We have the most disposable income right now and might finally make a difference in the world.
This is world wide brotha!
My boomer family members are evil. That’s all.
Worst generation ever
hey hey now. no need to fling feces at your elders, baby ape. there are plenty of boomer apes here supporting the shrewdness (look it up). and plenty of Xers and Millennials sitting on the sidelines.
Millennial here and my boomer dad has been listening to me and every week no matter the price he come up to me to say that he is buying ten more shares. I dont even know how many the old man has now
Very little of war is fought on a literal battle field with bullets or bayonets.
It made my PP go da doing doing doing
I always hear James Darren in Star Trek DS9.
Triple triangle, now that's just absurd!
What does it mean???
If Melvin realized a loss on GME this past quarter, wouldn’t that mean they’ve covered at least some of their shorted shares?
Gamma squeeze
IBD is only one source of many many places people/institutions can borrow shares. If they run out it means nothing at all because they can get them elsewhere.

At best it’s a gauge to see how many are gone from that one place, but doesn’t tell us much more than that
Somewhere (in WSB) I read that when a company pays dividends that the shorts have to pay them.... is that true?? And why haven’t the shirts been paying the gme dividend?? Very dumb. Please excuse.
> Can we be sure that GameStop hasn't sold any of its 3.5 million shares though? I'm not sure when we would find out if they did choose to sell them.

The reservation is for *up to* $1B raised using *up to* 3.5M shares, which would require a stock price of $285 if they wanted to reach the former goal within the constraints of the latter. I can't say with certainty that the board wouldn't be happy with a lesser amount (like $500M) but if they're looking to maximize their take wouldn't they wait?
Reason #2. Look what I can do......
How does this have so many upvotes lol.   I am long $GME and have been since last year but these unrealistic expectations swirling around in an echo chamber are fucking retarded.
incestuous! what about her boyfriend?
Meaning that ‘true’ SI is being hidden by shorts via etfs, and ftd’s which have thus far been continually reset via shady mm / hedge options trading.  No fucking way is it 10-15%.
I’m giving you the award to put emphasis on that
Mine will be a 4bt
Gme rising would most likely cause volatility all over the market, meaning it would also go up
Do the other one
One would be better off just buying GME
yeah my entire portfolio is gme and vix calls lol
I am doing this by buying UVXY call options
National Securities Clearing Corp. who settle up all positions when the hedgies can’t so that people believe the market can be trusted.  Regulated (ahem) by the SEC and bailed out by the U.S. of A. taxpayer.
They already announced it. Look at their prospectus filing
Just invest part of your 401k then! I’ve got  AMC/GME shares in a cash account, HSA, and IRA.

They certainly are words.
Fail. They've got the caah-on-hand. Moreover, THEY'VE NOT PAID OFF YET, merely announced.
I have a teenage daughter so I understand that reference.
And lamp..
hello fellow ape i eat crayons can you please explain what max pain means
Ah the fun stuff
Cake!!
Sheeeeeeeeeeeesssssshhhh
They want to maximize gains at $1B. To get to $1B, they need a share price of at least $285 ($1B / 3.5 million shares \~= $285). They'll be releasing the shares through Jeffries, and not necessarily all at once. If they do it, they will do it in an intelligent way to not crash their share price.

Besides, the fewer shares they sell off, the less the dilution for the board members and directors.
Proof?
Well institutional ownership is still over 140% of the tradable float and that float is small. also there's a 20% short interest on that 140. some big boys didn't cover and short interest calculations now include the fraudulent shares created during dick in the ass shorting events
If the short was only 3.5mil shares, none of us would here.
If the stock is over 100% shorted, that would mean they would need 70 million shares to cover, and that isn’t taking into account any synthetic shares. The 3.5 million is a drop in the ocean and nothing to do with that.

In fact GME are as good as saying they want to sell as high as possible, using as few as possible shares to get their $1 billion. They are alll aboard the rocket
I told this a lot : You sir, you belong here!

But in your case I wish reddit would have a "YouBelongHere" award, I would buy it for you.
So you’re telling me that hedgies are going to buy 3.5 millions shares at +$140 each when they bet that the shares would go next to bankrupt? 

They aren’t buying any shares. That is the whole point of this entire situation. They bought puts, thinking they could bankrupt the company along the way and a few smart people caught on and retail blew this shit up. 

THEY ARE NOT GOING TO BUY AT ANY PRICE OVER $1.
Shut up
Imagine positing in a thread about GME if you don’t like it with a snotty guided meditation troll


Explain yourself, FUD.
Neither.
190 a little low I think 420 on 420
Yo what is FactionFinancial?
No, this is completely made up and baseless.

Yes, the math of $1,000,000,000 ÷ 3,500,000 does indeed check out with the $285 figure, but it's not a "we will sell only when these two lines intersect." Instead, they are simply limiting this to $1b *OR* 3.5mil shares, whichever limit comes first. They also said "from time to time," so that means they're not doing this in one big lump sum. It can be 100k shares next week, followed by 1.5 million shares the following week, and price could be $100, $300, or $420 when they decide to sell, up to them.
It would have to go way over 285 for them to sell off 3.5m shares. Example. January when gme hit 345$. Someone quickly sold off 2million shares. Gme dropped from 345$ to 111$ to even back out at 220$ for them to sell 3.5m shares and get the price they want they need it to be higher. Plus dont quote me on this but I read somewhere you can only purchase a certain amount of shares per transaction so let's say 1million per transaction. So they are going to have to do 3.5 transactions by time they do there first 1m shares at 285 price will drop back to 180s. Just my assumption
Whoaaaa double triangle! All the way across the graph! What does it mean?!
Inception angle
What's that?
Not only that, silver is going to THE MOON!

Forget about GME, buy Reddit silver and OG silver.
I would like to thank you for that statement. It is a wonderful statement. In fact, theres no better statement than the one you made

Yes, only from Bulgaria and only from a boy.
all over your face!
That’s an understatement
The problem I see with this opinion is: Whose hype and momentum? WSB? Retail investors? 

I hate to break it to you, but we can't move markets. WSB is not some populism-fueled pseudo-hedgefund capable of driving prices from $16-$480. If we were, do you think the price would be declining right now? 

What happened was a result of the fundamentals that were already there, and people taking advantage of it. Do you think any of that has changed because retail momentum has died? Do you think that it can't happen again because retail isn't as hyped anymore? 

GME could very well be a bad play and die on us all, or it could still rocket into the stratosphere. But neither scenario will be because of retail traders. The play isn't dead because we aren't the players, we're audience.
Short it than pussy
I’d love to hear your counter DD, or thesis, and any evidence or statistics as to why you believe this.
Cultists? I just like the stock.
It's neat to see all the smoke coming out of your ass, just curious on who's cum you had to swallow to ignite that fire? Vlad's or Ken's?
Gen x here (I think, not sure cutoff,  but who cares)  I'm all in on this, convinced my kids to research and but in too.  we are all in as a family!
Doesn’t retail already own more than 70% of this stock? This is our stock. Holding forever
Nah. Gen X is the Jimmy Carter of generations.
Man, I miss Funcoland
I knew I wasn’t the only one....
I don't believe it. It's almost too good to be true
I only hear the Bayonetta version now.
If they actually covered their losses wouldve way higher than just 49%
isn't it based on current holdings across the board (assets, or lack of in this case) not just capital?
1) absolutely. You borrow a share, you only borrow the right to sell it, with the obligation to return it later. It does not confer you the dividend rights. You absolutely have to pay the owner his dividends.

2) GME did not declare dividends for Fiscal Year 2020. The last time they declared one was March 14, 2019.
generally a stock drops by the same amount as its dividend when those go out so its basically a wash there
No, he’s got a point
When the HFs hit every sell order available and they still need to buy more, 10 mil doesn't seem that far fetched.
Exactly
[deleted]
Investors will go for gold or other tangible assets if there are big liquidations.  GME spiking is bad news for the overall market IN THE SHORT RUN.

I still like the stock .
thanks
Yea ik. But OP is saying that them announcing was their choice. 

I think it would illegal to not announce this beforehand.
I wanted to but they wouldn’t let me pull any money out
Hahahahahahh amazing. I just discovered him and I’m already scouting my Versace bath robes
SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESH
I’ve heard that before. Still doesn’t answer my question. The stock is quite lower than 285 now. As volatile as the price is, who would pay 285 for it?
You could google this you know 

https://www.ssga.com/us/en/institutional/etfs/funds/spdr-sp-retail-etf-xrt

https://etfmg.com/holdings/GAMR_fund_holdings.csv?=1618316310
No. It’s not. Holdings are mostly still from 12/31 you have no idea what institutional ownership is.
Thanks. Just curious. Holding my shares still...
No wrinkles.....
Sure but since the date 4/20 is paired with the meeting on June 9th, I think $69,420 seems like a better price target.
My upvote was 69 nice!
That is the minimum value placed on the shares. It's certainly not going to be a block offering, but that is GME's unofficial price target over the next few years.
you are right, the relationship between those number is not linear. 1B is the goal, and 3.5M shares is the budget. We cant read too much more into it than that
Theyre planning on selling at $69,420. I can feel it in my tits
No one said anything about selling, so, what?
3D doritos?
How many bananas does it require to make this triangle you speak of?
It's what Kenny G goes to sleep with every night
squeeeze on silver
Sir this is a Wendy’s
AH, IT'S IN ME EYE

AAAAAHHHHHH IT BURNSSSSS
Retail can’t move markets but can certainly move a single small cap stock. There were less than 2M people on WSB before GameStop apes invaded. The GME float is 54M so if each of you mouth breathers buys 3 shares you own near half the float.
I’m selling options on it the premiums are insane and the price barely moves it’s amazing. I hope you retards keep it propped up as long as possible.
Theres isnt any. Never heard of any these clowns offer any counter to our dd
A failing retailer with tons of debt and only $6.5B in revenue ($220M net loss for 2020) is not worth anywhere in the stratosphere of $9B (current market cap). For reference, Macy’s did over $17B revenue in 2020 and has a $5B market cap and they actually are turning things around. GameStop is not. Digital downloads will continue stealing their business and this console cycle is already past its peak. The analyst price targets which are mostly sub $30 are correct and I’d even say they are generous.
Keep holding that bag broke bitch. Losers always lose.
No
Nah...we haven’t even had a Jimmy Carter to put in office yet. Mayor Pete was the closest we got to the stage. We’re a special breed of fuck this and short positions.
This sharp downturn before their eventual end is colloquially known as an "It do go down."
Yup. How could they be down only 49% if they actually covered ANY material quantity of a short position?

If they shorted at $20, a 49% loss would mean they covered 100% at \~29.80. We know for fucking certain they didn't think about covering at that point.
Makes sense. And the fact they aren’t being made to pay them is because gme hasn’t been paying them anyway. Thanks!
I see it as a real possibility
Yah but I mean if they do 10$ a share we would bounce right back and hedgies would die lmao
Jesus christ I am losing brain cells
Oh yeah. I get it. Lol. I guess I misunderstood your comment intent.
I’m saying don’t pull it out. Just buy shares with the 401k as is. You won’t be able to pull the gains out until age appropriate (unless you pay the penalty) but you won’t have to pay capital gains tax like you do for a cash account. NFA just what I’ve done.
Brother there are people here who paid $380 at the peak in January lol. Just because you wouldn't gamble your money on a volatile stock doesn't mean others wouldn't!
The same people who paid 483 for it
Welp. Let’s see on June then. Recent filings have shown continued buying of the stock.
This guy fucks
> That is the minimum value placed on the shares

No it isn't.

They can sell $1 billion worth of shares **or** 3.5 million shares.

It's not "we will sell 3.5m shares for $1 billion". If GME tanks to $10/share the max they could sell for at that moment would be $35 million (10 x 3.5).

If GME somehow hit 100 million a share they would only be able to sell 10 shares.

It's not them setting a price target or a minimum value on shares.
The company is selling so you don't have to
3 bananas to make a triangle, but only 2 if one of them is long and curly.
she loved it too
That may have been true from $16-$60, but it stopped being true quickly after that. 

And your point about us owning the float has two fallacies that I see. The first being there's no way to verify exactly how many shares WSB owns. I personally doubt even half of WSB owns GME. And second, assuming we did own that much of the float, wouldn't you just be proving your own self wrong?
Lol tons of debt? Are you actually retarded?
Takes one to know one I guess, I've personally taken a liking to this bag. Seems to me someone's a sour sally
GME doesn't have enough cash to pay a $10 dividend. That would cost them over $600 million dollars. GME's net tangible assets are around $420 million. If they completely liquidated everything they had, they still wouldn't be able to pay it.
You must be new here. Stick around to lose your remaining 8 brain cells so you can get on my level
since you’re so smart what’s a “reasonable” price you think it’s going to ?
Finally someone has some brain cells.  The amount of “10 MilLiOn iS mY FlOoR” posts are too many, people need to realize it will def not go that high.....
I’ll look into it. My 401k is through my company and I’m not sure I have the ability to use my funds like that
Yes, but I'd bet they don't just dump it out there as op said. They know what's going on, as do most of us. Why would they jeopardize us, when they, especially Cohen, knows we are here?  

And as I stated, I have no intention of selling any time soon.  I'm good on my retirement which I can't seem to do, and I could, but this has been way too much fun.  I like extreme volatility in my life which is why I live like I do.  I'm holding.  Maybe I hit the buy button, maybe I don't.  Either way, I'm with you guys.
I’d award this but all my money is in GME
dont feed the trolls
It’s one thing to be in debt when you’re profitable and have growing revenue it’s another when your business model is failing and you are losing hundreds of millions per year. It will take them decades to pay their debt selling used game discs online.
Lol sorry I was making a joke but I suppose silly outlandish wishes or plans are pretty common here and could be taken seriously
The problem is it's quite the opposite, I've been here for a few years and watched what the $GME saga has turned this place into lol
I started trading in Jan 2021. I feel like a fucking vet now.
And now they are downvoting me lol, this sub has turned into a cult and went to shit.   Like I am balls deep in $GME too, I am not the enemy here lol
remember tanker gang
You're not allowed to make sense on GME threads all the new tards won't let you lol
I have my price target that I’ll be fine pulling out of. If they want to aim that high and take that chance, let em.
What is the last word of my post retard? Oh right you apes can’t read. And it doesn’t matter if they sell them online or in store the market for used games is shrinking. You can download any game you want to play direct to console in minutes and there’s nothing they can do about it.
TITLE: Kevin O'Leary Live Now thinks a second kick of life is coming to GameStop, says "If I was short that stock right now I would be worried"TEXT: “I tried to invest in GME but they didn’t want to pay me a $1 royalty for every game sold and now they’re dead to me.”
"The upside is limitless"..
I am drunk idk what I am doing, I will probably buy more GME
Smart dude this O’Leary shark
The pivot of NFLX with the cult following of TSLA. That's a BUY for me!
Meet Kevin actually met Kevin
Well okay, another 2 shares for me
Dat Kevin’s blessed eye contact
We all were taught that 1+1=2 can't let them tell us otherwise. I've done my own dd nothing can sway me now.
The price right now is irrelevant. Hold boys.
He said the price is irrelevant. Confirmation biased is biased confirmed.
I mean that's just a common sense analysis. He's not being bombastic. He's saying that long-term, this is a good stock to own and that the short thesis of driving this down to $0 is absolutely off the table. This company is not going bankrupt like they hoped for last fall.
Fuccckkkk yeaahhh!!!! Tittttssss aaarrrreeeee jaaacccckkkkeddddd!!!!
One time I was drunk at work and asked Kevin O'Leary for money and he told me to get lost. After seeing this, I believe he changed his short position in me into long, similar to his forehead once his hair began to recede.
Can the guy on the left not bust a nut with his face the whole time he's listening? It's very distracting.
Sold more APPL to get more GME today. I love this stonk!
Mr.Wonderful is very smart. Listen to him shorties
Mr wonderful!!!!
I tell you what Bobby, that Kevin O'Leary fella is smart.
Guy with the beard moves like some kind of ai generated animation
You heard it here first folks, “the upside is limitless”
He's right. The folks who claim that $GME's fundamentals didn't change much between pre-Jan and post-Jan are dead wrong, just the brand itself got much stronger.
Do you see what I seeeee
All i heard was limitless
Credit to “Meet Kevin” Link: [**www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0)
Omg yesssss. I love this guy.
After GME squeezes, us retards need to make an “Ape Tank”
About as bullish as is possible
What was Meet Kevin laughing about while O Leary was talking. That’s awkward as fuck and I’m the king of awkward.
The crazy thing is, these financial Gurus are not even aware how big GME is going to be. They follow MSM and not the DD.
Panic bought 5 more
My man said Netflix, *not* “blockbuster”. Understood.  $450 bag holders see you when we see y’all! $GME will get you back to Sheboygan
You apes are going to the moon, and while I didnt buy I  early I will cheer you on!
This is to all the fucks in denial of GME’s potential, you think you’re smarter than O’Leary? I think not.
"The upside is limitless"

Thats all I need to know. Already 100% of my net worth in Gamestop and holding to the moon.
Literally halfway through this interview right now lol
So Kevin O’Leary is in, bias confirmed, holding to the moon!!
This needs more coverage, great stuff
The comparison to Netflix is perfect.
please... come back for us apes that got in at 300
Well there goes my chance of hoping it would dip down to $40 a share again so I could YOLO some more tax return money at it. Guess I'll just have to hold tight to what I have and wait to see what happens next.
Who is the guy on the left? And where do I find his content
Bruh I almost passed the fuck out out

2 reasons:

The absolute unscrupulous incredulity of some mfs &

Seeing the truth come to light in real time is always a breathtaking affair
So, buy more GME? Got it.
In other words, he bought in
Sorry, this guy interviewing Kevin is making me very uncomfortable with he smiles and intense eye contact. Is he in the room with me?
THE PRICE IS IRRELEVANT! KEVIN FUCKING KNOWS
Dude on the left is wearing and using a pocket pussy
If they wanna draw in foot traffic at their locations, they should openly and actively advertise selling TCG cards and give more focus to card games. I know some locations already do this with Pokémon preorder cards , but they should extend it to Yugioh too. You wouldn't believe how many pissed off disappointed moments i've had going to a local Walmart or Target, only to find out the ENTIRE stock of trading cards is sold out. They even end up selling out at Game Stops that do this already too.
The pride of r/kevin right there!
That’s right shorties suck my fucking nuggets
would someone help out a baby, what is this IP he's refering to?

Thanks and to the moooooon
KEVIN!!
Upvote and share
Wow. Go Kev!
“And I’m not short” bullish af.
Just what I needed to hear
Thank you for finally calling out how this has helped GME’s brand recognition!!!!! GME FOREVER
*And for that reason, IM IN!*
Bullish AF
Another mark off on the bingo board
Like Kevin said “the pricing of the stock is irrelevant right now. If you are short, you are hurting” lol. Well said Kevin. HF fuckeries can try. We will not let go our stonks. I got 5 more at 132 today.
Look investing is all about risk/reward. The risk/reward with shorting is terrible. Max you can make is 100% which isn’t really realistic and max downside is unlimited....
Kevin has a plastic smile. Can't tell if it's because he's a landlord or untrustworthy?
whys the dude look coked out and keeps showing his teeth like some kind of Great Ape trying to intimidate
B u l l i s h  A F
Lol, dude sells out and makes ads for Robinhood, fulfills his obligation, goes long on GME and starts advertising it within the month. 

What a shark.
Confirmed - mr wonderful long GME
Got it!! Buy more!!
GME time!  They wanted the big hammer. Now it's about to drop.
'The upside is uh limitless'
GME was the stock that introduced an entire new generation to the stock market. They will be in the history books forever. Quite possibly the most infamous stock to ever exist
1. He said GameStop has been on the tip of everyone's tongues for "5 months"
2. He's saying GameStop could have a "second" kick of life? Didn't we just experience the second kick?
Beardy guy looks dumb af

Edit: I meant his beard looks dumb at. He looks better without the beard.
i hate this scumbag. i really do

but he feeds my confirmation bias so I'm willing to listen to him.
I hate this guy and his clickbait thumbnails
I don't like the fake Shark Tank background behind Kevin, and for that reason, I'm out.

I’m sorry but that bearded dudes face creeps me out big time when he’s talking to somebody. Might be a nice guy but if a dudes face looked like that and was talking to me in a bar I’d be like I need to go check something over here for a minute outside in my car and I’d leave.
This is good insight. I still have a question that I can’t seem to get answered though. How long can the dark pool be used and how will them using it affect the rocket launch? Positively or negatively... I can’t imagine it was meant to be used in this way, was it?

Edit: I can’t spell

Perfect.  Time for lunch.  Good interview.  Much needed.

Why does he look like a villain in a USA TV Show?
He really is Mister Wonderful.
Technically: a baby shark is still  a shark...

1200$ buying  more.
Lol ooh shit
My fav shark right here
I like what he said right at the end. The upside is limitless
Let's get this trennnnnnnnnnding baby
The pricing of the stock is kind of irrelevant at this points
Kevin Paperhands wanted O'Leary to say "its going down", his face said it all after "the shorts are hurting" comment.
Smart man. He knows GME is gold baby
Kevin & Kevin my mind is blown
That’s the dude.. he’s a smart one.
Always loved O’Leary, he’s smart and tells it how it is
First time I’ve ever agreed with this dirt bag
Buy before the hype gets bigger. Simpsons predicted trillions.
I like how he says "and I'm *not* short".  methinks Mr. Wonderful is holding onto a slice of sweet, sweet, digital transformation pie.
You would think people would probably get the idea that shorting GameStop might not be the best idea...
You hear that? Thump thump thump THUMP THUMP,..... I hear the DRUMS OF WAR
He should be Head of Shareholder Relations
“the upside is limitless” ... ya think?!?
2 kevins, 1 dip
While I agree with what his face hole said, that guy is a moron
Note: Canadians lie too. Don't trust a word this fucker has to say.
GameStop taking over vacant malls with different games in each space, selling food and sponsoring tournaments, new game intros, interviews and music events. How totally wholesome and revolutionary would that be?????
Banana craving intensifies
"The upside is uhhh limitless."

Smooth brain ape like that.
I don't know how anyone in their right mind would think GME is ever going to get anywhere near zero.  She hits mid-double digits and retail is going to buy every last one in a matter of minutes.
Kevin o’leary is shorting gamestop in other words
We need to talk about Kevin
ive never been a fan of oleary but i respect him on this point for coming out and saying it.
“If I was short that stock right now I’d be worried and I’m not short”. 

Did O’Leary just announce his long position?
Fuck this guy. He is the reason Canada sucks. He doesn't give a shit about a regular person.
The upside is limitless!
Mandatory fuck Kevin O'Leary tho.
Kevin O'leary is a scam artist
HOLY MOLLY! HOLY MOLLY! HOLY MOLLY!
You puppets are going to fall for it again lmao
Thanks to the glorious bastard who watched this entire interview and posted the relevant parts here.
https://gmefloor.com
Kevin O’Leary takes it in the ass by Jim Cramer. No lube and swallows when Jim is done.
aka "I am long the stock but I missed the first two boats" 

F'in O'Leary, dude's been moderately successful in business (M&A in some software co's back in the 90s) and has been trading on his name ever since Dragon's Den/Shark Tank.  It's not apparent he has any other redeeming qualities (except believing in all of you of course!).
is he out on bond from when he crashed his boat while drunk and killed a father of three?
If this Kevin is doing bull promotions; it’s time to run away.
My name is Barbra and because my name is Barbara and your product is fine, I'm out. And for that reason, I'm out.
MEETKEVIN!!
the host looks like a fellow ape lel
If Kevin supports, that means he is shorting
Their faces look like they have been deepfaked
I've said it once I'll say it again. 

GAMESTOP - Turn your stores into LAN gaming centers and charge by the hour like all the LAN bangs in the South Korea <3
why is he using a green screen
Why is the guy on the left looking so gently and earnestly into the camera
“I’ll give you $500,000 as a loan at first with 3% interest. Once you pay me back $325,000, the following $175,000 will be straight equity. However, I’d like a $1 royalty on each game sold until I reach my $500,000. I’m Mr. Wonderful! This deal is a no brainer. Oh, no deal.... you’re dead to me and someone is going to smash you like the tiny cockroaches that you are.”
“The upside is limitless”
And for that reason, I’m out
Barbara: i'm not even in this video, therefore i'm out
Two for now...
You think they're not already in it?  Duhhhh
Well instead of shark tanks, GameStop is in ape barrels and DK ready for some bananas
...and for that reason I'm out. ^^^/s
and for that reason, *I'm in.*
The limit does not exist
Drink more then buy.  You might accidentally add an extra zero or two.  Thank me later.  

*This IS Financial Advice
As long as you dont drive a boat and kill folks ;)
You’re gonna need some alcohol to chase down those tendies, so your investment strategy seems to align with market forces.
This is we why you disable your sell button
I’m waiting for my disability benefits to come in so I can buy more GME. I’m also drunk and will be again tomorrow when the market opens.
He's fucking right though.  This shit is dangerous af to short.  I was bearish overall GME but just opened a long position this morning.

That plus max pain next week shooting up...
He is a shark. He said he s not shorting but he could be buying the dips. The guy is a proven successful investor he knows when to buy stuff. It would be dumb to miss out on this
Ehhhh, his [Celebrity Jeopardy appearance](https://torontoist.com/2015/05/recap-kevin-oleary-embarrases-himself-on-celebrity-jeopardy/) says otherwise. Tough to finish almost $3k in the red, but he managed to do it. Sucks that his charity had to cough up that money to get square with Merv Griffin. /s
No he isn't. He tried to run for prime minister of Canada on a Trumpian platform.

He also may have killed someone in a boating accident and made his wife take the fall, but no one talks about that.
Mr. wonderful
O'Leary (sorry Mr. Wonderful) is a dick
Nope. He's just a [crooked shithead with a horrible business record.](https://www.nationalobserver.com/2016/01/26/news/real-and-shocking-story-kevin-olearys-business-career). Even his investing history on Dragon's Den was subpar at best. But he became famous for being an asshole on a reality TV show, and somehow people think he's a genius.

But, you know, this cult is going to hype whatever supports their worldview, so there's not much of a point in trying to correct you lunatics.
he could be right or wrong, but he as a person is retarded
He’s no u/deepfuckingvalue but he’s alright
He got his wife off a negligent homicide charge without a hitch too.
He's gaming the moonboys right into his hands.
Hell fucking yeah.
What does this mean!
The problem is Netflix pivoted to its own platform. GameStop can’t put its platform on any major console, the digital PC market is taken up by Steam, MS/Xbox, and Epic, And Amazon, Nvidia, Google and MS/Xbox are fighting over the streaming market.
You think the stock is actually worth 100 plus per share? Serious question.
My dude on the left is an abundant fountain of joy that cannot be contained
Ooooooogh stay frosty my friend!
And I have been bleeding all day.
Yeh this has kicked me over the edge for going all in. How good are echo chambers.
We know Barbara's out though, lol. I think she literally said something along the lines of, "I like this too much and for that reason I'm out."
I thought I *was* autistic.
His setup is actually so unorthodox, but it’s unreal.
That other dudes face the whole time was fucken bugging me out- dude was biting his face to keep from talking
Which Kevin?
I've also did my very own DD by reading all the DDs from foreigners on the internet and deciding which specifically fits my own confirmation bias the best.

Not a financial advisor. I eat crayons. Also I love the stock, not going to let go of it, actually I love it more than I love to eat, which is why I truly consider skipping my next 10 meals in order to buy more gme. Again not a financial advise.
It may be irrelevant, but I'd prefer it to be higher.
<*checks the math*>

It's good.

<*nod*>
I think he’s careful not to go so far as to say it’s a good stock to own. He clearly stops short (heh, puns) at saying it’s simply a bad stock to short. 

But he’s definitely saying the company has truly valuable assets in its IP/brand and in its real estate ~~holdings~~leases. His rationale is that they can, in theory, leverage the visibility of the brand/IP to better utilize the real estate they ~~own~~lease in a new way that drives cash flow by opening up new streams of revenue. 

He says they can “hold classes” in their retail locations, which I don’t think makes much sense lol. But his point is basically that they aren’t beholden to using that real estate for retail locations. If they do what Netflix did, and move to a digital distribution model for game sales, rather than a brick and mortar retail model, then they can utilize those spaces for something *else* to drive revenue. 

Any retarded ape can come up with their own ideas for what those retail locations can be used for. The thing that’s left out of the video is that GameStop now has new leadership coming in who realizes the value of their real estate (it’s pretty obvious that 1700 locations with 1,200 sq ft per location is valuable (edit: because those *leased* spaces can be used for all sorts of business models, not just retail video game sales)...), who understands the value of digital distribution platforms and knows how to operationalize one (Chewy is a gold standard company as far as e-commerce goes), and who likely won’t be afraid to turn GameStop’s current business model upside down (it clearly wasn’t working).  

So I think he’s right to say the current stock price doesn’t *really* matter. Of course, it does matter in certain respects, but ultimately the current share price isn’t an accurate reflection of where the company will be 6 months, or 1 year, or 5 years from now. There’s tons of potential, and that potential simply cannot be reflected by the current share price - it’s yet to be determined whether they can reach that new potential that’s opened up for them. 

Honestly, the ripple effect emanating from the movement behind GME is just starting to be felt. People are starting to see what DFV essentially saw - a company with great assets being poorly run by shitty executives. The distraction of whether the shorts/hedgies are artificially deflating the price or whether retail investors are irrationally inflating the price has run its course by now, and that has allowed people to finally come to their own conclusions about whether there is actual value in GameStop as a corporation. And it seems like a lot of people are siding with DFV now that the dust has settled.

Edit: Clarified that GME doesn’t *own* real estate, which is an important enough distinction to warrant an edit, despite completely missing the point of why O’Leary sees value in those real estate leases.
Exactly. So, why are so many people on reddit, twitter, and the media so set on getting us  to sell a good long term stock?

Nuff said.
This has been the case for a while now. Everything you see now is a function of hedge funds trying to delay the inevitable without triggering the nuke.
In short, he likes the stock.
IM JACKED TO THE TIIIIIIEEEHHHHTS!!!!!
Are you drinking now? ;)
Dude what's it like working at shark tank??
I literally had to cover his face with my thumb lmao. Wtf dude
APPL or AAPL?
Why do you hate money?
He’s Meet Kevin and he makes 3-4 YouTube videos a day and has a lair that would make any of us cream. But he spends most of his day staring at a screen.
I’d be willing to bet he isn’t, and that he won’t invest until they prove they can do what Netflix did and move to a digital distribution platform. The guy got his start selling software, he’s very anti-brick and mortar retail. It’s expensive and unnecessary overhead in his mind. 

He’s a very shrewd investor. He wants almost guaranteed bets. And right now, GME still has a very unforeseeable future. He clearly sees enough value to be confident it won’t go bankrupt, but I don’t think he’s confident enough yet to give his money to them.
A little stock shining in the night
Is Kevin a good finance youtuber?
You wouldn’t be seeking investment capital after receiving all those delicious tendies—they’d be seeking you
Think he just trained himself to alway be smiling when doing interviews and it just looks a bit forced and awkward when he does it. A lot of people get stuff like that drilled into them when learning how to do stuff like interviewing and whatnot. Though I think that's generally bad advice. Just don't look disinterested and be emotive and smile if it's appropriate, but mostly, just look natural.
They factor in things that we don't follow, like all the free goodwill (the word used as a technical accounting term) GME has accumulated. There's infinite factors in the analysis, they focus on some, we focus on others, MSM focuses on others still.
Here you go.  [**www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FBuXIBeepC0)
I was thinking the same thing. I couldn’t stop looking at the guy during the video Bc he was doing some weird shit with his face
On one hand, you're right.

On the other, I REALLY don't want a large corp running LGS's out of business, and hope they never do it.

Wait, why are you buying your cards at Walmart/Target?  Find a local game shop, the prices are always far better anyway.  When I played MtG I was getting packs at 75-80% Walmart/Target prices.
Something we clearly don't have...intellectual property. He is referring to the brand name in this situation.
He’s very intelligent just maybe a little bit on the spectrum
I love people like Kevin - because he makes no apologies for being who he is. A capitalist vulture doing exactly what the system was designed for him to do. The same with Shkreli - We need people to expose the worst parts of our system to fix the SYSTEM. Hating the kevins and martins of the world is hating the PLAYER. HATE THE GAME.
Which one? Kevin or Kevin?
dude same lol. he's creepy as fuck for some reason and I can't place my finger on it.
“I think this company is amazing and want to invest”

“We won’t do a royalty deal”

“Oh just kidding your company is literally worthless and your whole family will get murdered by Target.”
He is a great lowballer, he's got more money than he can use so if he gets a deal that's near 0 risk with those terms and someone takes it he's OK. If they don't take it, he's OK too.

I got limit orders for amzn at 2678 and tsla 470 and pltr at 16.70

Really low good till cancel orders and pltr and tsla can swing down fast.  I got enough of them so if they don't hit that limit I'm happy if they do hit it I'm happy

Its $180
It’s the unshortable stock
Wow you've been doubting us this whole time up until just now
The hype is gone on GME because the stimulus was already spent and the trade on this turd was over months ago for the day trader crowd. The general public already lost their asses and the WSBs crowd are just going to be averaging down back to 0.00 unfortunately. You can't listen to anyone in the media, especially somebody like Kevin O'leary with ties to CNBC and Wall Street. The media's sole purpose is not to inform, but to get you to take out your wallets and put money into the hands of the smart money.
You are reading more into his statement than what he said. He said it would be bad to short the stock and that he hasn't. He probably bought at $40 and is confident that the company is going to stick around and not go bankrupt. That isn't the same thing as buying it at $140 on the hope that some bizarre market thing happens to make it worth millions for "reasons".
The dude is as rich as he is because he doesn’t gamble with his money. He doesn’t need to rely on something like GME where predicting what it will do and when it will do it is an absolute shitstorm, my gut says he isn’t putting any money in. He’s just watching from the sidelines and rooting for retail because there’s nothing guys like him and Mark Cuban would love see more than greedy shorting hedge funds get shredded for billions.

This guy knows about one thing: investment markets. 

If a subject has nothing to do with investing in any regard, whether directly or tangentially, he’s not gonna know shit about it. You think he knows what year the Magna Carta was signed? You think he even knows what the significance of the Magna Carta is? The game of Jeopardy! is not suited for a man of his character. 

Now, if the categories were Keynesian Economics, Game Theory, American Conglomerates, White Collar Crimes, Squeezing Blood from a Turnip, and How to Prove Marx’s Theories on Capitalism Correct, well then he’d run the board.
This sub is hilarious. If O'Leary had said "GME is garbage, dump it now" every GME moron would be screaming "who does he think he is?!". They would downvote it to hell, dig up all the dumb shit O'Leary has done and call him an idiot.

Instead...he said something they agreed with. And therefore he is a wise man, his opinion is relevant, and we should upvote it. Literal cult thinking on the front page.
I'd trade my internet smarts for being retarded and rich
Agreed, he moved to florida and moves all of his businesses to florida to avoid paying taxes. This same guy told people to get off unemployment and go intern for somebody 75 days without pay to prove your worth.
Nobody knows what it means but it's provocative
means these shares will be passed on for generations
Basically in the late 2000s,.Netflix I did a similar business shift as seen with what GameStop is doing. Also, GME has a very enthusiastic base, as seen with Tesla, due in part to g*mers™ and a cult of personality of RC and the stock.
Netflix had a great business model pivot that proved out in spades despite initial backlash.  TSLA has a cult following that makes the stock price severely out of whack with their business plan.  

Combining both is the dream.

I've done my own DD, using the DD of others as a reference point. Not all of the numbers add up, but a lot do as well. It's obvious there's a lot of confirmation bias out there and you have to be wary of that. But after doing my own research, it still looks to be on track for what we're expecting from it. I'm buying more friday when I get paid, here's hoping for the moonshot soon! 

Edit: Not financial advice.
This is not health advice either...
GME doesn’t own its own real estate. They lease all of that and most of it is on short term leases now, with expirations 2-5 years out. GME is many things, but a real estate play they are not. This isn’t Sears.
Yea Gamestop goes digital, use the stores for MTG, DnD etc and sell accesories or whatever

Yeah brother, it’s fishy as hell.
because a stock being a good long term prospect does not mean any price is reasonable. I'm not saying what is and isn't reasonable. but I can look at a stock, believe that company is good long term, and also not believe it's a good buy at $300 a share relative to it's earnings, or even future earnings. there is a point where it's too expensive for even a good long term company. 

Google isn't going anywhere for example. It's a good long term buy. but it's not worth $10k a share today.
Whether or not its a good long term stock doesn't change the importance of position. This is a stock that traded at $5 for years. If it levels out at $130 that is HUGE. People who were buying calls at $500 are going to have a bad time.

Who isn't???
It's hard to know. He bashed Cryptocurrencies for years and recently came out and said that he's been invested since around 2017 or 2018 so who knows really? Definitely a shrewd guy anyways.
He's pretty solid. Tons of content, usually several videos a day. Sometimes he'd do live streams of market open, market close, interviews, and major announcements then still put out a deeper dive video all in the span of a day... All while also making daily private videos for his course members... 

He's a machine at the very least, even if you don't agree with all this analysis's. He's also very apolitical, which a lot of people like when he's reacting to how political decisions will impact the economy / market.
Can we start a new show where GME holders interview the sharks to see who we feel is better to invest in all the new companies apes will be starting?

The maximum number of options expire out of the money ensuring the most possible profit from premiums by whoever sold the options
Market makers extract maximum from people speculating on price action from options (puts / calls).  In other words max pain is the price that market makers make the maximum profit.
then it’s bullet time.
There are six answers above me right now. (I counted the range as two answers). If you average them all out, you get $217.50. 

There's your fuckin DD
It was $200-$220 from what people are saying
http://maximum-pain.com/options/GME there you go
180 last i saw
Around $205.
I believe 300. 200 EOW
Depends on how you calculate it.  If you go by when calls / puts total OI are equal, yes.  But if you go by which strike they become equal in OI it is around $205.  I tend to think the latter one is more predictive, why?  Because the close to ITM MM's are most motivated to see price action, not the people who are at deep OTM extremes.
People with that much money have investment opportunities all over the place, and GME is just one of those options.  He doesn’t need to be in on it at all, or he could be in at $40, or $100, or be day trading the peaks/valleys, etc.

His comments don’t reflect anything other than “there is positive opportunity here given their brand IP value has skyrocketed, so shorting something with positive opportunity is dumb.”

Similar? Haha... The companies are not even remotely comparable and that was almost 15 years ago now. That's a lifetime ago in this space.

GameStop still has *nothing* that is in any way revolutionary or industry leading whatsoever. Every potential play or "pivot" they could have right now is contingent on entering markets where they're already 10-20 years behind and full of established competitors that haven't just been sitting on their asses. A big part of their main revenue stream that originally got them as big as they are was the used game market where they ripped people off for years buying used games and reselling them for huge margins of profit while cutting developers out of the picture, which only sped up the direct to consumer digital sales landscape so that GameStop and their ilk could then be cut out of the loop themselves. Moving to more of an online focus will still have them be limited to physical sales of products for the vast majority of their revenue stream as they are not a developer, publisher or even a digital delivery storefront of any consequence.

Their best bet in the next few years is shutting down as many unprofitable B&M locations as they can and aiming to become a gaming focused Best Buy and NewEgg hybrid.
Netflix's pivot was planned from the start. They were waiting for technology to catch up.  Otherwise they'd have been named DVDs-By-Mail.com.

GME's turnaround is brought on by necessity under very different circumstances.

I don't like digital downloads. I'll take that shit on sale, and I'll take the PSNs free games every month, but I've got 200+ PS1/PS2/PS3/Xbox360/PS4 games on disk and that means I can play them until I'm 80 years old and die

And I'll pass them on to my wife's kids along with my single remaining GME share
You are the dinosaur now...
that's a bingo!
So you're saying if Gamestop started selling porn, more people would shop there? Because that's the only reason to use bing over google, or so my wife tells me.
Bing’s video search is on point tho.  Google’s sucks.
Lmao, you can't be serious. Google revolutionized how the internet is used and has billions of customers. Nothing GME has or does is unique.
That's because when someone creates a platform on the internet, it becomes very difficult to move them to a different platform. 

That's why people bitch about censorship online. There is no other space to go. This is the public square now, and the only attempt to move to another platform was squashed by the tech industry.

Thanks! And could this affect the price of stock ?
But shitadel is a MM isn’t it? I thought the idea of max pain was to fuck them up.
Aw fuck I can get DDs for less then $200.

Correct. They lease all their space. I work in commercial real estate leasing retail space. GameStop has been doing limp along deals the last 5+ years in their brick and mortar spaced kicking the can down the road on 1-2 year renewals. They don’t own any of their locations. That said; they can still use their brick and mortar locations differently and better than they do today.

Worked there. In HR. Can confirm.
I was security so luckily got to avoid that, one of the happiest days of my life was getting to do the “we need to talk in the office” speech to one of those obnoxious fucking team leads though
I worked there and they didn't maintain their equipment so the safety latch opened and I fell out of the cherry picker 20 feet onto the cement floor of the back room. I was out of work for a year. After I returned, they fired me 3 months later accusing me of stealing. Im now part of their safety videos. Because of them I had to have my hand reattached, have permanent nerve damage in my spine, suffered with chronic pain for 20 years and I'm slowly losing the use of my leg. I'd short them into oblivion if it was possible and actually get what's owed to me.
I don't understand those enough to use that option, this is already enough risk for me at this junction in my life.  More risk would take away from my peaceful days of naps

This is the best comment I've read all day.
Uhhhh hes the only albino gyno rhino i know
It's not a coincidence, but it's also not necessarily a conspiracy either. Max pain theory basically operates on the assumption that MM will try to push the price into the max pain, so it's not like this is something "new" or unique to GME.
That's the theory, that contracts for options represent 100's of shares.  Therefore it is in their interest to buy or sell shares or influence the price closer to max pain.
That is the most important question in this subject and that is the only one all the DD didn’t answer. At least for me.
Yeah but they'll just look like huge skin balloons.
Why is max pain at $200-$220 next week?

That's just where the call and put order placements put it.

Is that accurate? Idk. I don't have access to that data.
Past two weeks it’s been around 170-150 but start of this week a lot of the call strikes doubled in open interest so that’s why the increase
help my smooth brain understand...  usually a higher put-call ratio means it's time to sell and a lower ratio means it's time to buy. correct?

Albeit 2.7 seems abnormally high..

Are you viewing the 2.7  as a contrarian indicator, buying when the ratio is above 1 and selling when the ratio is below that figure??

To provide some perspective from a long time store manager at GameStop, despite boneheaded company moves over the years, a fair majority of the stores remain profitable year over year. I started as a holiday hire in high school and stayed for a long time, spanning fifteen years. I managed four locations over the course of my time there and each one earned enough money to cover the cost of the individual store's payroll, product and utilities, in addition to generating profit for the corporation.

Things have been getting worse for years at GameStop, but overall the stores still make money and have a lot of loyal customers. Even though you can get your games online or at Walmart, the best stores had staff that were knowledgeable without being overbearing and easy to talk to. They were just fellow gamers who wanted to get excited about new stuff and geek out with you. There will always be a value to that, no matter how much of the industry moves digital only.

My point is that, try as they might, a lot of stores make money, at least enough to justify their extended existence and I don't personally see the company folding any time in the near future. I think we will continue to see certain aspects scaled back. If you've been in one recently, they cut a lot of the unnecessary shit and the overwhelming in your face marketing plastered across every spare inch of wall and shelf.

New leadership is good, but GameStop has had a lot of "new leadership" the past few years and they need a steady guiding hand as they develop a new identity or evolve into something else entirely.

I’m sure the stores make money is the corporate overhead I’m concerned about. They typically aren’t a profit center and spend more than the stores make. If they can trim the fat at the corporate level, use this new brand to their advantage and transform their revenue streams through different channels then I would say it’s currently undervalued despite the short interest.

“We ain’t fucking leaving” - GameStop
Why it matters https://twitter.com/DOMOCAPITAL/status/1382064324248735744?s=19
Just came back from GameStop at a local mall. Tuesday afternoon.... packed to the tits.

Bought $600 in goodies. Came home with a new oculus, used xbox(as a gift), bunch of accessories, and games.
Cohen: "This isn't working"

Board: "We know, which part should we fix first?"

Cohen: "All of it. Reset everything to 0. Get rid of everyone. Pay off all the debt. Redo all the stores. Redo the website. This is a new company. I do not ever want to hear 'but we used to..' in this room. No you didn't. You didn't used to anything because the company we're building didn't exist before today. You can keep the logo. Maybe."

This is what companies need that aren't making it through the internet revolution, but they're too scared to do it. AMC could really use this type of attitude in their corner.

EDIT: wow, thanks everyone. your love of my comment has inspired me to start writing screenplays. I naturally think in "scenes" like this and usually I'm the guy giggling to myself when nothing funny has happened.
this is the way.  cash flush.

This hopefully will bring in some more investors tomorrow to help spur the battle.  if the news media doesnt warp it of course!
Holy shit! Panic buy tomorrow
Right on!
\*Ape Noises\*
Cash/Equivalents as of last release was $508 million

Long Term Debt was $216 million (Now $0, $292 million cash remaining after this announcement)

Current Debt as of last release was $147 million.

Other than fucking hedgie bois, any reason to pay down all short term debt (assuming interest rate would be lower on this?) leaving $145 million cash/equivalents and debt free? Thinking about it like my finances (am retard though) why pay down low interest debt when you can make more gainz than interest owed?

This is bullish af. $140 per share is a fire sale.
So what does this mean for a retarded ape like me, cause I just put in a purchase order for 5 more shares
AMC has a debt clause that states its loan must be paid in full before a share buyback can be undertaken. Is the same true here? If so, could GME be TRYING to set off the squeeze? (Just ape mumbling to myself....)

Big news. Bankruptcy irrefutably off of the table now
I lika da stocka
Papa Cohen is getting all of us apes jacked to the tits!
Can anyone explain what this means? Good news or bad news?
Brilliant because paying off this debt early allows GME a lot of flexibility going forward. Including ability to issue dividends, share repurchase, selling assets and mergers & acquisitions. Bullish af.
Am retard please explain what in flying fuck does this mean?
Real talk what does this mean?
It's stuff like this that make me think that RC isn't going to be playing this like some regular corporate dude who just sells new shares to make money, he is using this as it's own catalyst to create something totally different.
Acquisition time, who we liking?
Really looking forward to the 10% drop in the first 15 mins of tomorrows session because clearly a company becoming more solvent is a sign to fucking sell your shares
Waiting for the motley fool article like ... O\_o
This can't to up tits!
Dang I really needed to hear this such bullish news, I swung some pltr and tesla at a loss last week then sold to buy more gme on chairman news. I was a bit pissed after I watched gme tank and then the next two days pltr and tesla rally.
Can someone ELI5 me on this? it sounds good, but why?
BOIOIOING! AWOOOGAH! and etc
Explain this to a retard
This is probably just from all the money apes have been dumping into the company! Kidding, that would be a ton of plushies sold,but what if.
It’s Ben a pleasure holding with you gentlemen. Glad to see our tendies are on the horizon.
Ryan Cohen announces share dividends exactly equal to the current market price at the same time they release their 3.5 million shares. Everyone doubles their position, money goes back into gme, Ken jumps off a Building.
I don’t know if this is good so I will just buy and hold k
Can somebody APESPEAK this for me?
Lots of horribly failing companies do this kind of thing I'm sure.
So... What's a senior note?
I'm so fucking erect. Time to use my credit cards to buy more stock.
Tits.
 viagra got nothing on this.
I'm scheduled to get my first dose of the Covid vaccine on April 30th. Coincidence? Maybe. But just in case I'll let you all know what day the second dose gets scheduled for.
Can someone ELI5 this and the potential benefits/negatives
Seriously endless good news cud we mix it up a bit?
Can someone translate
Translation for retards please? Is this good?
Can I tell my boss to fuck off yet?
Okay so someone please say retard. I want to know what does that means.
what does this mean?
What mean?
to be honest i dont understand a shit
Dude I didn't know that my tits could get this jacked! Probably waiting for me on the moon by now
This entire battle has been so epic for GameStop. They really alienated a huge part of our generation by doing things like offering tiny fractions of money for used games. You could literally be standing next to the value they were reselling it at. I had stopped going to GameStop entirely. Now they have an absolute resurgence of loyal customers from this. What a crazy turnaround.
Great stock
So, are we going for dividend, merger or both? %)
Free of debt as GME...


Ah, yes, the dream...
No fucken idea what all this means. Buy and hold?
Definitely the signs of a company on the brink of bankruptcy...

Edit: /s if it wasn’t obvious to you.
the bear thesis has been obliterated today. Now it's a question of where the stock will consolidate, and just how much it will grow in the coming years. This is ignoring the pink elephant in the room on a unicycle with an economic ICBM strapped to its back that is the looming infinity squeeze
Unreal news (also the part of it mentioning of how this removes the restrictions the bonds placed on acquisitions, dividends etc) price jumped 1%... If this was 2 months ago the price would have jumped much more than fucking 1% on that news...

Manipulation at its finest, thanks SEC, once im outta GME fuck your market in done and I'm sure there will be a lot to follow
That shoots down all the negative share offering stories
Can someone explain everything in ape terms and what that means for me a 10 share stock holder
This is good and bad.  It's good because paying off debt frees up cash for other things and I'm sure there were negative covenants that now are no longer a limiting factor (though I dont know what they were, haven't looked)

It's bad though, because the business is still hemorrhaging cash.  They need cash to fund the turnaround or they're going to have to keep taking it from investors.

GME remains the most interesting stock in the world.  If only apes would shut the fuck up.
This increases the chance that these HFs get margined called. They're absolutely screwed.
Notes....being?
Someone please explain wtf is going on, cause my brain is smoother than my wife after a fresh wax before a weekend away with her boyfriend.
Could someone answer? I'm just curious what all this really means.

* Is it possible that this was blocking them from selling their stock as well? As soon as they're debt free they can sell shares and generate money to operate on the transformation?
* If a company spends money to pay debt is it then considered less valuable on the market (technically they lost money and therefore value)? Does it mean such news make the stock price fall?
Well, now we know who has been selling stock this week... Or at least, it's likely GME. They have some time to report a sale under their at the market plan, don't they?
Literally the first time I've ever seen people get so excited over a call of a massively ITM bond.

This has been expected for months. Was even in the 10k IIRC.
God damn dude I have only seen one other of those terninion awards out in the wild and to stumble across one on something as retarded as this comment made me fucking lol
ahhahahahahaha literally laughed out loud. thanks for that
Hola
Heard he’s related to dirty sanchez
400 mill in cash to be exact!
Wait, can you explain? If they didn't sell a share, where's the money from?
So imagine when they sell their ATM offering shares.. all 10 of them because the price will be so high
How do you know they haven't sold a share? Didn't they make a filing saying they can sell shares at market price whenever they want? Do they announce beforehand?
Who said there's no greed on earth???
Wait, then how did they get this money? They didn't exactly make more money or keep more profits the last year.
Just like ape
Are we going to be rich too because of it?
Then we will buy in the shade!
Good thing I’m waiting to buy lol these hedge fuckers are trying to get the price as low as possible before the 15th
well, you see people never cared for fundamentals when it was at its peak so now it has lowered I think that sentiment is still here. if it drops based on good news that just means people still think its over valued when talking about its business.
This is the way
Ya know, I'm so bad at averaging down, I never know when to sell, then buy back on the $5-$10 dips, sometimes I do it right then other times I dont and I am back to square 1 lol
With it dropping 10% a day for a week and giving only  1% back,(sounds like a credit card)
I can have no days like that. My 43k account is now 20,  all in GME
lol this ain’t PLTR
Yep this is huge, it frees them up to do a lot more things as listed in their 10-K filing, selling shares and quickly having even more cash on had being one of them. MOASS preparations!
Can I see it?
SIMPSONS DID IT
A trillion dollar prediction? Located entirely within GME? ...Can I see it?
are you feeling it mr krabs?
Simpsons predictions always come true.
If anyone was still hoping that GME was going bankrupt just lost that hope.
yes as it kills the bear thesis that the company would go bankrupt to lenders and it allows them to issue dividends and aquire smaller companies
They should have borrowed more to buy GME shares.
Now this is how we make money

So everyone buy GME

Cause the hedgies lack liquidity

Cause they all went short on GME

God the lack of talent is palpable!
The short thesis was likely tied into this debt, the restrictions that came with it and being unable to pay it off.
Analysts upgrade gme from 10 to $12!
Now the short thesis is.... value investors thought it was worth $25 or $30 bucks a year ago, and not a lot has changed on the business (really a wash between the unexpected console disc thing, offset by lackluster holiday sales vs expectations), and the stock is now $140... Actually far more sane than the prior short thesis, which was one of the most crowded trades on wall street with that 250% short interest.
How the fuck does that even make sense when gamestop could have repurchased all of the gme with part of the beer money in their coffers for a good while there?
And yet they double down again and again. They better post their loss porn here when this is done.

My short thesis is that the company is excellent but not worth 200 dollars. Hence why I'm short.

It cleared all debt? The sec filing said 10% of senior notes. 

Am I missing something?
I swear to god this team running the show are so smart. So can they actually announce a dividend on 6/9? If so that would mean if no one recalls their shares, GME can still issue a dividend and there for screwing over the shorts anyway?
OH MY FUCKING GOD!

This is absolutely amazing news. This company is not fucking around.
Did you see the part about issuing equity? Which is what they've stated they want to do?

AMC needs to demo some of their older theaters and convert them into drive thrus with blue tooth connections for people to bring their own headsets.  Just do PW verification on a randomly generated keychain for people to sync with and have people bring food to their cars old timey style.  I know not everyone has convertibles these days but plenty of people have trucks or SUVs or what not with decent space to sit in the back if you just back the car in.

Well, as others have noted, they’re NOT debt free. Only the notes which paid 10% were paid—so no debt on those specific notes. The balance sheet still has liabilities. Anyway, I’m not sure how the market will respond. As others have said, there was never any regard for fundamentals ever since this squeeze began. Hard to predict how people will feel about it.
>  allow them to offer a dividend

They have no need to give a dividend because no fear of investors leaving - my $0.02
GME borrowed 100 bananas with the promise of giving 100.6 bananas back later. They are now making good on said 100.6 nanners.
If we get up to 250 by Friday we'll gamma squeeze. The options chain is...out of this world.
All that with only 2 commas & 2 periods.
Look at short term and long term debt. 

From memory I think they had 900 million in short term debt. This is mainly goods in stock that’s just waiting to be sold (it’s a debt you have to carry if you want to have products on the shelf). 

The long term debt (equivalent of a mortgage on your house) they had was 200 million. And now it’s gone. 

This is AMAZING news. A company in trouble does not pay off debt. This company is poised to go through the fucking roof.

EDIT: look at smart monkey below. Most of short term debt is in fact not stock but rental commitments.
From what I read good news but I’m beyond retarded
They are paying off their debt 2 years before its due. 

They are paying off their debt. 

No debt. 

This company has no debt. 

What part don't you understand?
its just that no ones interested in a highly overvalued stock with a low SI. 

no new buyers isn't manipulation.
Means you are a millionaire in waiting, congratulations
Where'd they get 500M if the business is hemorrhaging? Didn't they spend 2020 closing a ton of stores that didn't turn a profit?
Gamestop paid its credit card. Have lots of green left on its bank account still.
Holy shit check his post history.

GameStop still has other liabilities but this is then paying off all long term debt. The long term debt is in the form of senior notes that have a 10% interest rate.
not 10% OF senior notes, ALL senior notes issued at 10% rate. They still have $147million short term debt (and about twice that in cash after this long term debt payment)
They still have 800m in capital lease obligations, current debt, and another 1b in various other liabilities. This sub can’t read a balance sheet.
Such great news GME stock can only go down another 20% in the morning
That's not entirely true, no more long term debt but they still have short term debt. about half of the remaining cash. Dont get me wrong this is great news, but "debt free" isnt really accurate from what I can tell

Short term debt is like 114 million only.  

900 million is what is owed for rental of premises over the entire duration of what is left on leases.   Who here wants to pay their rent off right now upto 2030??
I understand now, thank you. I'm new to all this, so they got a flat quarterly earnings (which seemed good for a pandemic) and yet their stock drops. They look for a new CEO and the stock goes down 12 percent. I literally don't understand what moves this stonk and so reading this it looked good, which means I can expect the stonk to dip tomorrow?
Everything’s manipulation to them, no use in trying to explain it to them. The cult-mentality doesn’t allow them to reason.
How you watched the dark pool footage? 

I was ignoring all mention of that shit/max pain etc...

(I'm not one for insane million dollar pts or any of that shit.. Been in GME a long time and bought and sold few times to turn 6k into 269k) 

until I saw two different videos going around of shares being routed to the dark pool symbol. One yesterday just of a feed of GME routes and another today of GME compared to Microsoft. It was eye opening to say the least. Roughly I'd say one in every 3 GME shares at least was being routed to a dark pool.... compared to far far less for Microsoft.

A fella in our discord has millions in GME, has been in it for like 2 years, mega well known bull, uber uber smart and familiar with finance etc..... and even he is completely discouraged by this dark pool stuff
Yea, my dude has a window seat for him and each of his 6 kids he adopted a few weeks ago from Dian Fossey.

They’re sending out a notice on the 15th for shareholders to recall their shares before the 20th for their right to vote in the shareholder meeting. 

If Blackrock (and other major shareholders) recall their shares, it should shoot the price right back up.

Their game is to drop the price as low as possible before the 15th so the recall doesn’t shoot through the roof and start the margin calls.

So, personally, I’m expecting another major drop tomorrow (which I personally will be buying) then an big increase on the Thursday, Friday, Monday, or Tuesday.

That’s the theory anyway, wether it happens or not is a different story.
Seymour the house is on fire!
Better sell soon after 1 tril.. itll go -2 tril quickly...

I don’t think they are debt free, but this bag was a heavy one. It’s a very good sign that they payed it off so early.
Still have 150 million debt. This was all the long term debt though I just looked at the gamestop balance sheet on their website.

That something like a dividend payout

Can only be done to real shares

**NOT SYNTHETIC GHOST IMAGINARY SHARES**
This is the way
pardon my smoothbrainedness

But doesn't that mean they could also issue new stock to raise capital?

that would be opposite of what we want to happen, but does open that door.
Thanks for the clarification!
current debt is half their leftover cash and equivalents, biggest issue is some guy tweeted "debt free" and everyone ran with it. I dont think it's a stretch to say this is good news. Certainly helps cash flow over the next 2 years.
Oh no… they must pay rent.  This is terrible!   Where else can they sell their stock inventory.  Whatwillwedo!

Walmart paid 1.7 billion in rent last year, and owe 18 billion in future rent.  900 million in rent obligations long into the future is nothing.
When you buy 1000 consoles from your supplier you say: “thanks for the delivery, I’ll pay you in 60 days”

Supplier says: “ok, your a trusted partner. I can wait 60 days”. 

You now have a ‘short term debt’ that you put in your books. But you also have 60 days to sell the part you just got delivered before you have to pay!

Every single company in the world that has suppliers has got short term debt. 

I do not know enough of their delivery and payment terms with all their suppliers to judge if it would be beneficial to work on decreasing or enlarge the short term debt. 

Do you think a company like Amazon pays cash on delivery? 

Tl;dr: short term debt not bad, means goods on shelf.
OH NO A COMPANY HAS SOME DEBT, THIS HAS NEVER HAPPENED IN THE HISTORY OF THE MARKET
Also they can likely renegotiate the debt and while the interest and terms would be a lot kinder, any senior loans will have standard restrictions and negative covenants like that.
If you have an especially sexy voice, then yes
Good for you, my dude :)
No, this is Patrick!
Agreed this has got to be whale bait. I suspect one or two were part of the process. The timing seems to line up with a consolidated effort.
“Max Pain” for options expiring Friday is around $145 I believe... so we’re already making them hurt as much as possible at current price.

Thanks for correcting me! I didn’t check the numbers before replying. 

 This just makes this news even more bullish!
It will dip as long as the shorts have money left on them. If this was a normal stock it would skyrocket to Uranus after never ending good news one after another.
yeah this same process was going down in January during the run up as well, this is nothing new..

I think you're reading a bit too much into these, since they're all still reported. 

There's largely a sell off in retail GME, that shows in the L2 data. 

Additionally there are block trades going down, probably to deal with options this Friday.

So far there's no evidence of what you're claiming. Why would prime brokers put themselves in a position to be jailed for an underwater hedge fund? It just doesn't make sense. 

Unfortunately for you guys there isn't a big retail demand for a stock that's at a 3900% ATH. 
Most sane folks know to stay far away from that shit. And so the trend the last well few weeks is people selling stock they bought with funds they cant afford to lose.

You're in a small echo chamber when compared to the market itself.

I have an extra $10K in case we get a massive fire sale (< 120? < 110? < 100?). Otherwise I am pretty comfortable where I am.
No mother, it is just a 1 trillion market cap!

what’s an exit strategy?
I'll be outta here in 4 months!
I figured it went from 50T to 48T, -2T was just a 4% drop

They only have to pay rent on premises for the duration of whichever leases, which is a cost of sales, helping them make money by having a place to sell shit. 

Yet people think it's a bad thing …  and expect that they should already have their rent paid upto 2030 or so  for all their locations.

"Oh no!  They are 900 million in debt.  It's doomed!  Doomed I tell you!! " for rent payments years into the future.  

Go figure.
Ah thought that was last of their liabilities
I think this was pretty much it
It was the bag forbidding them to invest and 'transform' the company, for me that's the best news we had for days
Weird. They did the same thing late last year I believe. The rockets followed closely
Why don't you think they are debt free?
Underrated comment, however, the early payoff on this block of debt is very positive news.
Some places penalise for paying debt off early.  Just something you forgot to mention.
I came at the same time you did. We’re linked

True, but the real magic is that THE SHORTS have to pay that dividend out of pocket for all of the shares they’ve borrowed and sold to other people
Every held share gets the dividend. With from the company directly, or payed by the short selling selling a share they don't own.

If there's a one dollar dividend, then every share has to be paid $1 from someone.
Also mentions acquisitions. This could be HUGE for the future of GME.
Fuuuuuuuuuccckkkkkkk. I need shreksophone blasting right fucking now
or....maybe like overstock.com did, and fire out crip toe dividend payments. i mean, look at who theyre trying to hire
What if the real magic is an acquisition that can't be signed until the notes are gone?  May surprise?
Putting aside the debt and further lease obligations, They have 492m in AP which is a liability they have to pay in the near term and had a cash flow from operations of 126m last quarter. If they’re spending 40% of their cash in retiring senior notes it basically makes it a certainty they’re going to use their shelf offering to dump the maximum number  shares as possible onto the market so they can meet their current cash obligations unless there’s some sudden spike in physical video game disc sales this quarter.
Not to mention Walmart has much larger storefronts than GameStop does. You find a GameStop in a strip mall so if GameStop wants to buy out of their lease it’s no big deal as the strip mall can just rent the space to someone else. If Walmart decides to close the literal warehouse of a storefront that was built for them I’d imagine that would be a little more tricky to do. Who the hell would fill that space if Walmart left (nobody). And to your point, GameStops future lease obligations are quite microscopic compared to other retail giants.
Yeah I'm pretty sure that's a normal part of business. You collect payments from your customers as quickly as possible, and delay disbursing money you owe as long as you can reasonably get away with.
lol love the downvotes on zero disagreement just a quarter tendy of nuance.

Just to further clarify though, wouldn't what you're referring to be considered accounts payable on the balance sheet (which they separate from current debt)? Not tryna be a douche just tryna maybe learn something or confirm previous knowledge.
Does this mean dividends for shareholders? That would even bring the theta kids up in this bitch
Max pain is for both sides, calls and puts. Max pain means it fucks over the most options holders regardless of what kind of option they hold.
Just be lucky you aren't a tenant of his.  He expects everyone to pay their rent upfront in full in one lump sum at the start of the lease, and not in regular monthly payments throughout the duration of the lease. 

Makes complete sense /s
The offer extends to anyone else that needs someone to get them through this most difficult time.  How about you?  Do you need a person to chat to also?
People celebrate good news. First day on this planet?
April 15th will be a good day my friend
Those are Willie's retirement bananas!
A 1 trillion market cap?!

Entirely in one stock?!!

That stock being GME?!!!?

^(Would you sell me one?)
Steamed hams!
I bought more.
For -2 trillion to be possible it has to reach 2 trillion first!
They have other liabilities -- mainly store leases.
Honestly I’m not sure. I’m seeing comments that they are indeed debt free in which case that would be fucking sweet.

Holy fuck no you're right, this sounds like a good recipe for hurt dick
Every chance I get.

Ape can count?
This sounds too good to be true. It sounds "make Mexico pay for it" level of too good. How are shorts forced to do so?
GameStop may do what overstock did and issue a digital dividend.  Overstock issued 1 stock for each 10 stocks you owned.  Link with more info.  https://realmoney.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/overstock-is-paying-a-digital-dividend-and-it-gets-really-interesting-now-15037958
But even if the shorts have shorted 140 million shares, at $1 is it gonna have any impact at all?
It's crazy what BS people latch onto and try and portray as doom and gloom.  

What do people want?  GME to sell on Ebay and pay Ebay fees and PayPal fees?

But yeah, Walmart is pretty fucked for that 18 Billion.  No one talks about it though.  God forbid, it might actually tank the price.  18 billion is a stack of 100 dollar bills, all piled upon each other, 18 times the height of what the World Trade Centre was.  That's how big 18 billion is.
This, the idea is to sell the product before your vendors come knocking on your door for the money you owe them. If done properly like Apple or Dell, customers pay you before before you even cut the purchase order to your vendors which means the money the company needs to support those purchases isn't technically theirs.
$200 is ~15k Calls itm. 

$140 is  ~2k Puts and ~2k Calls itm.

$100 is ~16k Puts itm.

Exactly so sell between 1-2 trillion no need to be greedy
Incorrect, ZERO liabilities!! Balance sheet is PURE ASSETS. Shit doesn’t even balance!!

It’s one of the best ways to blow up shorts. GME only pays dividends to the shares they issued. But everyone holding a share is entitled to the dividend payment, the shorts who borrowed and sold them short are legally obligated to pay whatever dividend it issued to whom ever they sold the shares to (naked, synthetic, etc.. all of them count)
You can see what happened to $RKT when they issued their dividend to try and shake shorts.
If i borrow your stock to short it, you still technically have ownership of the stock.   When the dividend comes, whoever borrowed your stock is on the hook to do one of two things.   1)  Buy back the stock and return it to you so you can collect your dividend, or 2) pay you the dividend out of their pocket. 

This ultimately results in two things.   Shorts cover their position and buy back their stock they borrowed, or the short position holder spends more money to keep their short position and just cover the dividend cost out of pocket to whoever their borrowed the stock from.

If someone is short say 100000 shares, and maybe their position is down 20% but they expect it to recover, it may be more cost effective to just pay out the dividend and wait for the stock to go down.  Or of course someone in the same position who doesn't have the $100,000 capital available may be forced to buy shares to cover their position.

Long story short, anyone short either needs to spend capital to continue their short position or buy back stock to cover their position.   Stock either goes up from buy backs, or short holders lose money.   Win Win.
look at the RKT 3 month graph. The spike to $40 was when their CEO said fuck you to the shorts and issued a special, one time only $1 dividend
To me, this is probably one of the best outcomes for apes. Hedgies can't just offer cash, they will have to buy their shorted portion of the ~70m Gamestop coins out there. Coin prices rise to astronomical numbers as each hedge fund tries to get their hands on them first, before the next HF.
Hnnnnnngggggg
140,000,000 impacts
Right, but what if the dividend is $20? $1 was just an arbitrary number thrown out there as an example.
People can think of any reason under the sun to shit on GME and I don’t understand why there’s so much hate. They are making moves and people are still out there saying that this company will be bankrupt before the year ends. Then you’ve got the TSLA gang who are glamorized for holding a company that barely (and I mean barely to the point of not being able to focus on production of new, perhaps more affordable/accessible vehicles) meeting production obligations. The first company to come out with an EV under $25000 sticker price is going to absolutely steal potential TSLA buyers at that point. No shade at TSLA but I could go on about their shortcomings and somehow that is a better investment than GameStop

Edit: I almost forgot, that 18 billion is a literally fuck ton of money but with Walmart’s market cap being what it is, I don’t think it is a huge problem for them.
He's ALIVE!!!   ALIVE I TELL YOU!!!

All rejoice!  Pay tribute to this man.
also in mine! i am glad you are well, sweet prince
Awesome.  Wise.
This is the way.
I hope this is a joke.  Of course they have liabilities -- leases, accounts payable, borrowings against a line of credit etc.

It would be better for the stock if they had gotten lots of low-priced debt and had fewer shares.

I see. So essentially after shorts bought 10 shares and gave an IOU to 30 people that they have 1 share each, shorts need to pass 1$ of the dividend to 30 people, for a total of 30$ dividend, or get taken to court for financial bullshit? Does that sound approximately right?

Now how does receiving a dividend work? If I hold 100 shares in eToro, and a dividend of 1$ per share is paid out, does 100$ just appear in my eToro "this is your available equity" field?
That's delicious.
What happened
$140m is nothing for a big hedgefuck like Citadel, right?
I thought the company should have had a very profitable year in order to pay such a huge per share dividend?
Can I pay the tribute in installments? Like once a month?
I'm finally popular! Hooray!

Yep. And if you sold 50,000,000 shares short, guess what. You’ve got to pay that $50,000,000 of dividends to the people who bought those shares. Not GME. They only pay the dividend to the 70.3M shares they’ve issued. And if you remember from the Bloomberg terminal drops, institutions alone own nearly 100M shares. There are a shit ton of duplicate shares out there
That's how it works for me with vanguard. Some brokers will ask if you want to do a recurring investment with your dividends though, meaning theyll put that $100 dividend payout towards more shares
Essentially, yes. The person holding the actual share gets the dividend: the shorter has no rights because no ownership. So by the time it’s bought to cover, the dividends are delivered to the actual owner.
It's called RKT for a reason
Ya, basically no impact. When you figure their loss might be $20-100$ per share a $1 loss isn't much. 

Though this could have a big impact on options hedges. If there are heavily margined or shorted shares as a hedge, it could have a big effect for those people.

And debt free.
Is... is that perhaps what the "we can issue extra stock" thing was for a week ago?

Ryan issues X amount  dividend. 

Shorts end up having to pay 3X dividend. 

Most apes use the dividend to buy more GME.

Driving the price up. 

More stock gets sold. 

More dividend gets paid out.
This is quite interesting with date April 30, can they announce a dividend payout before April 30 and then the shorts will essentially help for pay for that senior notes and also help pay dividends to shareholders including us APEs?
Smoothest of brains here BUT if you opt to automatically reinvest into the stock, does that force the shorts to create a synthetic share because all company issued are taken? And then pay the dividend on that stock making an exponential increase in synthetic shares to later be covered while bleeding them financially???
I love you
I'll take it
